1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:24,000
This is best with Christmas permission.

2
00:01:03,120 --> 00:02:11,600
And true Jesus and sorry for this peacefulness of the worst men with us to see for the father's love for it.

3
00:02:36,960 --> 00:03:24,160
Wiscib sing Jesus through this love is of being comfortable.

4
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:36,400
Let us sing to the King, Jesus Christ our Savior, for this day, through the love of the angels.

5
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:53,840
Life comes to the earth, lead us through the heavens, to the feet, Jesus Christ our saviors.

6
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:12,480
Christ with your human from above the farmers of Himself and love you.

7
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,000
Praise the earth, love the trouble.

8
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
Make the love for the grave.

9
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,280
Jesus Christ was born to save.

10
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,480
Help us to the king, Jesus Christ our Savior.

11
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,240
Wonderful, mighty God redeemed.

12
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,960
Son of God, Son of Man, hold in all I see.

13
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:15,360
Where the grace gives and grace, we shall make each turn of you.

14
00:06:37,360 --> 00:07:02,240
In the past we have shouted and desired to go home with the good sword to swear.

15
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:55,600
Hallelujah, all we angels say, Hallelujah in the sky looks like in the holy light of the world, best God gave you us a day.

16
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm the ringer bed, we're the birthday, for the birthday will be hallelujah.

17
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,320
All the angels say, Hallelujah.

18
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:19,440
Night of wonder, night of wonder.

19
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:52,960
The right can angel sing along to heaven of wonder, God of wonders, wear and heaven with birth its shoulders grave.

20
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:13,120
The shepherds on the hillside watching all their flocks by night were startled when they heard the angels sing.

21
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:24,720
Awakened from their sleeping by a brave standard light, they heard the news of Fred Sunday morning.

22
00:10:28,080 --> 00:14:59,760
And when he entered his favourite boy old town, so heard their rather in a major song that shone himself in human form, heard the past and come to be the Lord and Savior of us all wonders God of wonders Glory to God and me for everything of wonders God of wonders Oh we can do again the will to every bless the will to will fire In many ways it must have been a lonely life and those very homes to probably even religious by the people in their hometowns to the stable shepherds not thinkers not rich men not religious leaders but shepherds what kind of day is it going to be shepherds have they sent to Jesus the Messiah was going to be born that night and that they of all people was going to be issued the personal invitation that they were not seeing so I think if we could have talked with him they would afford to be just another day with all the usual things all the usual good things and bad things happen that God intervened and made it a special memory for the day this is the way God works another way of making special days out of those ordinary days without bread thou sleep in the town the angel of the glory shall go down fear not save he for mighty dread and sees their trouble the divine the truth is from this morning the savior is christ the Lord and this shall be the signal and you live in his place and me up in swollen grace and he are angels praise and lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around about them, and they were sore afraid.

And the angel said unto them, Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

24
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,400
For unto you who is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, Jesus Christ the Lord.

25
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:21,200
And suddenly there was with the angels a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, Glory to God in high and on earth.

26
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,720
Peace be with them.

27
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,240
Sing the fairy of heart, and the birds are free.

28
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,040
Sing the fairy skies, every day shall sing.

29
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,200
Take us to the place, Christmas time to Jesus.

30
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,480
Take us to the fifth single singers.

31
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,160
If by chance you could have looked upon that lowly stable in the outskirts of Bethlehem that morning, it was a strange sight or eyes as a whole.

32
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,200
The smell was not unlike the funny smell of any other stable in Alice New York.

33
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
They would have been scattered across the foreground.

34
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,360
Problems were plenty of timbers.

35
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,200
The shepherds would have been quietly seeding during the shepherds.

36
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,440
Shepherds were shepherds.

37
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
The heavens were exploded during the night.

38
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,240
The fire leaves were heavy, and now the arrival of the planning of the night.

39
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
They had come to be holding it.

40
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,040
The witches in the door had cheated the war.

41
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:18,800
Sing the child in the midst of the joyful way, charges on the fair.

42
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,280
Beautiful stone and fire towns, and the borders of the men.

43
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,120
The love is here to take through heaven.

44
00:19:10,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Mary's a sleepy winds of sheriffs are natural through the truth.

45
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:34,000
We are green, young patients, and love in prophets and hurts.

46
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:58,800
All the chains will say, Bring on the day of sound of the day.

47
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:17,920
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, the day of the earth became, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem and said, Where is he that is born in the Lord of Jews?

48
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
Where he is born in the Jews and coming to worship him.

49
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,280
Yes, the wise man came to worship Christ.

50
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,640
And every day, we will use that every time.

51
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,920
Many administrators are sidechains, both religiously.

52
00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:31,920
So not before you, as you would say, hills to enter the burning sand Traveling over the brain.

53
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:42,800
One can come games and wonder for games for you for the rain.

54
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Everything that is for nothing, for the window.

55
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,680
We have seen his sunshine in the distant sky.

56
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Everything is breaking.

57
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,360
Window, baby, never willing star.

58
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,040
William gifts and not the ring.

59
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,280
Music's going to make a far.

60
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
Loyal gifts for the free.

61
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:53,600
Let us see that it's for the king for the heaven.

62
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,120
We have seen his stars shining in the eastern sky.

63
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,440
Get it over in this rain.

64
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,160
I was using the boys right there and a few years and the days of paradise.

65
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,920
And behold, the king boys were using the youth.

66
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
And those four went before them.

67
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
And so the king and two were children before.

68
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,160
And when they saw the child, they were all.

69
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,880
And when they were coming to the house, before the young child was married, his mother could go down and work.

70
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:22,480
And when they had opened their curtains, they were going to come to them, golden, give some gold thanks to you.

71
00:25:24,480 --> 00:26:03,200
I said that all your holy marks, your Jesus, and our hearts for you and our heart for you.

72
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:29,440
Oh, joy with Christmas forever.

73
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:43,520
To the Lord, oh night in God.

74
00:27:32,880 --> 00:28:08,160
My love of wonders are likely to sin to thee as in the hand of the birth joyous ring.

75
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:25,680
The shepherds of the use of watching warned by night were startled when they heard the angel sing.

76
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:37,200
Awakened from their sleeping by a great Christian light, they heard the news of praise the new for me.

77
00:28:45,680 --> 00:29:21,440
So both they raised the new song The Son Himself and young best for meet the Lord and Savior of us all reach on earth.

78
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:50,800
The angel says God of wonders God will do everyone to everyone.

79
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:29,200
First of all, we thought about it.

80
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:42,240
We heard the different worlds.

81
00:31:48,480 --> 00:33:08,800
The person here, Heavenly Father, we have to thank you for yourself, Lord, and for your blessings.

82
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,040
Thank you for our pain.

83
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,200
We thank you now.

84
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,400
We could use the prayers.

85
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,960
Yes, we believe you praise the glory in Jesus' name.

86
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,280
89 of your temple quicks singing.

87
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,600
Let's stand together and we sing this.

88
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,400
Silent night, holy night.

89
00:35:41,680 --> 00:36:20,000
Sweet days hope we live upon thee.

90
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:32,560
Just sing the peace.

91
00:36:34,240 --> 00:37:12,880
Christ uses Christ the Supreme Light Holy Light and this life.

92
00:37:22,080 --> 00:38:40,800
Jesus Jesus Lord Jesus Lord at thy birthday night holy night Williams of thy life with Jesus seems to our king Christ the Savior is for Christmas Lord Who you are.
