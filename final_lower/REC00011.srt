1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,920
Praise this morning for your glorious name.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,400
We do thank you, O God, that truly you keep us singing.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
You bring this joy in our hearts every moment of every day.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,720
You bring us happiness within our souls.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,880
O God, it's just a wonderful thing.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,560
Every person who is here this morning who knows you knows the joy of Jesus.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,160
Oh God, floodgates.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
Open them up, O Father, upon us this morning.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,200
May we go forth in singing joyful praise to our God, that the world may know that Jesus is the joy of living.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
In His name we pray.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,080
Amen.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,920
Now, if you would take your hymnals, please, and turn with me to hymn number 163.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,680
Check that.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
Make that 143.

15
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
Forward, we'll take this morning's offering.

16
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:20,560
Heavenly Father, thank you so much for being Lord of our lives and who we are.

17
00:03:21,760 --> 00:05:42,160
Dear Lord, at this time, let us not just give our whole body, but most of all, let us give ourselves so that you may dwell on and motivate us to go forth and live our lives in your name and God and our Heavenly Father, again we pause before you in the quietness of this hour.

18
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,720
Lord, just lift up our hearts before you just to hear your voice.

19
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,760
To hear, O God, the desires of your heart for us.

20
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,400
O God, our hearts are joyful this morning with the realization that God is all we need.

21
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,680
He is sufficient.

22
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
On the cross of Calvary, He paid the debt of sin.

23
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:39,280
He made it possible that all people, all men and women and boys and girls, all colors could come to Jesus and know what it is to live forever.

24
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
Oh God, how great is your grace.

25
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,560
How wonderful is your mercy.

26
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,040
How tender is your love.

27
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,640
Oh God, we just want to thank you and praise your holy name for all that you are.

28
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:07,760
This morning, oh God, as we just continue in prayer, we thank you, O Lord, that we can bring before you the needs of our hearts and the petitions of our souls.

29
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,880
Lord, we would pray especially today for those who stand in the need of your hand upon them physically.

30
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,600
We pray for the hellers, Lord, and they're still ill and from colds and flu or whatever it might be, oh God.

31
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,880
We just pray to you, Father, that you would just reach down and touch them.

32
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,320
Lift them up.

33
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,080
Oh God, we pray for Betty Brosi this morning and ask, oh Father, just to continue your hand upon her.

34
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
May she feel your presence.

35
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,480
May she feel your power in her life.

36
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
We thank you, Lord, for improvement.

37
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,920
And we just give you the praise for it.

38
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
Lord, we thank you this morning for Susan Reguger, who is with us.

39
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,840
And we just thank you, O God, that she is here and that your hand has been upon her and is upon her.

40
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,200
And oh God, we just lift her up before you and give you praise.

41
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,440
We pray, oh God, this morning for anyone, Lord, that is within our midst, oh Father, that is not feeling well, that your hand be upon them.

42
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,680
For any person out there, oh God, who is ill, that we have not mentioned, Lord, you know them.

43
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,240
And we just ask your Father to reach out to them and fill them, first of all, anew and afresh, with the power of your Spirit.

44
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,560
Fill them with your healing power.

45
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,840
And then this morning we come again to ask you, O God, to fill us full of your Spirit, anew and afresh.

46
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,240
Oh, that we may have open hearts to what you have to say to us this morning.

47
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,320
Thank you, Lord, for everyone.

48
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,440
Thank you, Lord, again, for loving us.

49
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,400
Guide us as we continue before you this day.

50
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,800
And may all the praise and glory and honor go to our wonderful Lord.

51
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
In His name, we pray.

52
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,440
Amen.

53
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,400
Thank you, Choir.

54
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,840
It's a blessing to see each of you here this morning.

55
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,080
Glad to have those who are visiting with us.

56
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,480
Pira's grandparents.

57
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
We're happy to have you.

58
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Happy again, of course, to have with us the riches, the rich family.

59
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,920
The riches.

60
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
We're happy they're here.

61
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,920
Lord bless you.

62
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,240
And so let's just bow our heads before God this morning.

63
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Thank him for his blessings upon us and for this service today.

64
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,160
Lord God, we give you praise for this moment and we ask, oh God, just to quiet our hearts before you.

65
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,240
May we be receptive to the Word of God and may your Holy Spirit enlighten us to learn more of Jesus and his love.

66
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,480
In Him we pray.

67
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,520
Amen.

68
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,760
If you take your Bibles, please, and turn with me to the book of John chapter 3.

69
00:13:50,400 --> 00:14:02,880
John chapter 3, we're going to be reading verses 17 through 18 and also John chapter 1 1 through 3 and verse 14.

70
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:19,600
First, we're going to read from the book, the third chapter of John, beginning with the 17th verse.

71
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,920
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.

72
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:42,960
He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

73
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,400
And then chapter 1, verses 1 through 3.

74
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,120
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

75
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,640
The same was in the beginning with God.

76
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,120
All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made.

77
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:26,800
And then verse 14 And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

78
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,320
Why God sent His Son.

79
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:46,800
When God sent His Son, the greatest, most precious gift that heaven could afford, left the gates of gold and came to this world of sin and confusion and corruption.

80
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,720
He came as the child of Bethlehem's manger, taking upon himself the form of sinful flesh and dwelling among us.

81
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:05,360
And then he bare the sin of the world in his own body on the tree, that he might bring us to God.

82
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,600
Truly, the greatest gift that has ever come to man is when God sent his son.

83
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:28,320
When looking at our wicked lives, when we look at our wickedness, we look at our sinfulness, we look at our sinful selves that we are, do you ever wonder why God sent his son?

84
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
I do.

85
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:43,920
I wonder sometimes how God could look upon me as ungodly as I am and see something in me that he wanted.

86
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:54,480
But then as I begin to think and realize and I feel that fervent spirit of God generating my soul, then I know why.

87
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,560
I know why.

88
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:05,680
You see, God looked down and he saw mankind in his ungodliness and his helplessness and groping in darkness under the curse of sin.

89
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,280
And he sent his son because he loved man more than he loved his own son, the only begotten.

90
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Truly, there is something that has been more costly and more expensive than war.

91
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,160
Beloved, it is sin.

92
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
It is sin.

93
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,080
What pardoned sin has cost, no one can fully reckon up.

94
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,080
The wealth of Christ's suffering and death to usward and to God is to a finite mind unsearchable.

95
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,240
What unpardoned sin will cost the sinner is a terrible and far-reaching question.

96
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:59,040
No sinner can ever be able to pay the price that the holy and eternal Son of God hath paid.

97
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:11,040
In the portion of Scripture that is before us in John chapter 3, there is a great fact, a great fact, God sent his Son.

98
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:23,040
And from verse 16, we have the words, For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

99
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:37,840
These words, of course, were the words that were sent by God, the very one himself, as he taught with Nicodemus that night many years ago, simply saying, God has sent his Son, and I am he.

100
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,240
And certainly the Son of God knew from whence he had come.

101
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:56,240
And from the very council of the Godhead on high, Jesus Christ departed and came to this world to be born an a lonely child in the confines of a stable in Bethlehem.

102
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:40,800
He who knew no sin left the glories of heaven and took a subordinate place to God and the Father and God the Holy Spirit in order to take the form of human flesh and to experience our pains and to experience our aches and our infirmities of the flesh to be subjected to the temptation of sin as we are tempted and yet to live a sinless life and then to go to Calvary's cross and to die as a sacrifice for your sin and for my sin and for the sin of the world in order that he might live, that we might live eternally with God.

103
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:53,840
Yes, Jesus knew from whence he came and why he was sent because like the Father and like the Holy Spirit God the Son loved us so much that he came to die for us.

104
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,080
Have you ever thought of it this way?

105
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:07,760
That God himself, God himself, had to come from the holiest and die under the curse of sin in order to conquer it and Satan?

106
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,880
You see, that was the only way sin could be destroyed.

107
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,680
And we made free in Christ as we receive him as our Savior.

108
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,960
It took the sacrifice of God's only begotten freely given.

109
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:32,320
There's a story of a woman in Kentucky who in time of war said to her only son, Go, my son, I give you freely.

110
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,280
And in this, she was exhibiting just a faint picture of the self-sacrificing love of God to a perishing world.

111
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:52,720
Now this mother could not foresee what was going to happen to her son, but doubtless she thought in her hoped in her mind he might return unscathed.

112
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:05,440
But God, but God saw the awful depths of sorrow and suffering and even death into which he was willingly gave his son.

113
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,400
Why?

114
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
Because herein is love.

115
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,800
Not that we love God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sin.

116
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
Why does God love us so?

117
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:30,320
Unloving back to God as man is, and selfish and greedy and withdrawn to ourselves as we are, and yet Jesus Christ King.

118
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:43,680
In this was magnified and manifested the love of God toward us that God sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.

119
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:57,600
And we wonder, after such love, after such compassion to sinful man as was expressed, how can so many turn their back on God?

120
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,240
How can so many go on and die in their sin and go to hell?

121
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,080
The Bible says, men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.

122
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,120
And you see, they cannot see because they're wrapped up in the world about them.

123
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
And the natural man cannot discern the things of God.

124
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,160
And so they go on headlong into their corruption and their ungodliness and filthiness.

125
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
And they have no thought for God.

126
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,840
Men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.

127
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,440
Not only do we recognize the great fact that God sent his son, but in so doing, God had a great purpose.

128
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
What does verse 17 tell us?

129
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,120
For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.

130
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,320
Oh, you see, the world deserved condemnation.

131
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,600
But when God sent his son here, it was not to condemn the world, as we would expect.

132
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,560
There was every reason why the world should have been condemned.

133
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,680
And after all God had done for his own people, the Jews, and yet they hated him in unbelief.

134
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,200
And the heathen that were even in a worse condition than the Jews.

135
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:30,400
Outside this little land of Palestine, the knowledge of the truth and the living God had almost completely vanished from the earth.

136
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:42,160
And you know where God is not loved and when God is not known, there is no love among those men and women around the world from their neighbors.

137
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,680
In every Gentile nation, idolatry and immorality were rampant.

138
00:23:48,320 --> 00:24:06,080
One has only to read the second half of the book of Romans, chapter 1, and be made to marvel that God did not, with one sweep, on the earth, destroy it.

139
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,040
But he didn't.

140
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
He didn't.

141
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,160
Beloved, things are waxing worse and worse, even in our day.

142
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:25,280
And maybe we wonder, why doesn't God just come and take his broom and broom it away?

143
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,920
He had other designs, gracious designs.

144
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,800
Last of all, he sent his son.

145
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,160
And then when Christ came into the world, he could have condemned it.

146
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,840
He was able.

147
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,680
He was God.

148
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,920
He was a creator.

149
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,840
And certainly with every perfect right.

150
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,840
And yet with respect to its condemnation, he opened not his mouth.

151
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,600
My what mercy.

152
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,840
My what grace?

153
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,760
My what compassion?

154
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,880
What love?

155
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,040
Why didn't Jesus condemn it?

156
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,960
Because his purpose was not to condemn the world, but to save it from condemnation.

157
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,320
He came to save.

158
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:23,840
Jesus himself was God's great and unspeakable donation to this poor and needy world.

159
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,200
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.

160
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,680
That whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.

161
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,960
Listen, our salvation is the gift God gave in his son.

162
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:55,440
And all that man can contribute to the salvation of the world, apart from the gift of God, is but for a few coppers that can never redeem a soul from sin and death.

163
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:08,240
We think about the work of the socialist and the philanthropist, those who desire to help mankind by acts of charity, and they're like a copper coin.

164
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,560
It is good so far as it goes, but without Christ it does not go far enough by any means.

165
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,800
Christ came to save the world, noting, and nothing else will be a substitute for him.

166
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,960
God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.

167
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,840
Now, of course, we know that this does not mean that every person in the world will finally be saved.

168
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:50,640
This could not be because Jesus clearly stated in the next verse that those who believe not are already condemned.

169
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,320
They're condemned already.

170
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,800
Jesus loved the world.

171
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,920
Jesus loved the world and he carried the sins of the whole world to the cross.

172
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,360
And the sin of the world was born in his body on the tree.

173
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,200
He is the propitiation for the sin of the whole world.

174
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,000
Listen, he stood in the place that every one of us deserved to stand.

175
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,640
Every one of us deserved to go to that cross, but Jesus stood in our place.

176
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
He is our propitiation.

177
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,760
You see, only those who believe on him are saved.

178
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,720
You see, the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient.

179
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:55,360
It's sufficient for the sins of the whole world, but it is only efficient for those who believe.

180
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,800
In John 5, 40, he said to the unbelieving Jews, ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

181
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,080
And oh, my friends, there are many in the world today, not just Jews, but also Gentiles, that will not come, and Christ has not condemned them.

182
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,480
Christ has not condemned them, but by their unbelief they are condemned already.

183
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,400
This brings us to our final thought from these verses in John 3 this morning.

184
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,080
We see there is a great responsibility.

185
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,920
Man must respond to the Savior in order to be saved.

186
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,400
He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already.

187
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,360
Listen, my friends, it is one thing to believe in religion.

188
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
It is another thing to believe in him.

189
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,160
Most people believe in religion of some kind.

190
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,720
Do you know what religion is?

191
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:10,640
Webster says it is a belief in a superhuman power or powers to be obeyed and worshipped as the creators and rulers of the universe.

192
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,920
Yes, most people believe in God.

193
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,720
There's a lot of people who may not, or they may say they don't believe in him.

194
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,840
But most people, if you can take account around the world, would acknowledge, yes, I believe that God exists.

195
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,280
They believe in a creator and that he created the universe and is a ruler of it.

196
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
But you know, that's as far as it goes.

197
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,760
That's as far as it goes.

198
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,840
The Bible says that even the devils believe in God, but they weren't saved.

199
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,520
The world can believe intellectually about God, but it doesn't mean they're saved.

200
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,200
Religion is also any specific system of belief and worship.

201
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:11,040
You know, one can believe in a church creed and be just as sincere and faithful in attending the church as there are Sundays in the year.

202
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:29,520
And since religion is also any object of conscientious pursuit, one could go out and conscientiously wash cars sacrificially and without charge every day of the week, including Sunday.

203
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:39,120
But you know, none of these things will avail anything because believing in religion is useless and condemnation.

204
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:48,560
But believing and trusting in Christ as Savior and Lord is everything is eternal life.

205
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,000
The promises of God are all made to us in Him.

206
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:06,240
For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and we are complete in Him who is the head of all principalities and power.

207
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,840
You know, it's one thing to believe in religion.

208
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,760
It's another thing to believe in Christ.

209
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,560
The difference between death and life.

210
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,640
Truly man's responsibility is great.

211
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,680
He is responsible for how he believes.

212
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,720
He is judged accordingly to what he believes.

213
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:43,920
And not to believe on him is to be condemned already, because he is the only begotten Son of God.

214
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,480
He is the only way and the only name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

215
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,680
Today, my friend, are you a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ?

216
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,840
Do you know why God sent His Son?

217
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,480
Do you?

218
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,800
That he may come, that ye may have life.

219
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
That's why he sent His Son.

220
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,360
The Bible tells us, as many as are in the works of the law are under the curse.

221
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,400
Let me say this again.

222
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,440
As many as are under the works of the law are under the curse.

223
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:35,040
But as many as receive Him, to them gives He the power to become the children of God, even to them that believe on His name.

224
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,120
There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus.

225
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,040
Do you believe on the Son of God?

226
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,520
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

227
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,400
This is the opportunity today.

228
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
It is your opportunity.

229
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,800
A great responsibility is yours.

230
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,120
How do you respond?

231
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,800
How will you respond?

232
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,280
He that believeth on him is not condemned.

233
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,760
But he that believeth not is condemned already.

234
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,200
Have you put your faith in Jesus Christ this morning?

235
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,920
Do you know him as your Savior?

236
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,960
Can you say, I know in whom I have believed, and I'm persuaded he's able to keep that which I committed unto him against that day?

237
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,480
No matter how far I fall, I have the hand of Jesus on my life.

238
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,440
I'm his.

239
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,400
I'm preserved in his grace.

240
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,640
Thank God.

241
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,280
We are preserved by him.

242
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,040
We are kept by him.

243
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,040
Because if we were not kept by him, every one of us would be sliding off into hell.

244
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,520
But he keeps us.

245
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,280
The Bible says we are kept by the power of God unto salvation.

246
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,840
We're in his keeping.

247
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
Rejoice in it and walk day by day with him.

248
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,600
Christians, keep your eyes on Jesus.

249
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,600
Keep your eyes on his face.

250
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,880
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory presence.

251
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,880
Are you here today without him?

252
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,640
If not, you need to receive him.

253
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,200
In a few moments, we're going to observe.

254
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,520
Again, we're going to celebrate the Lord's Supper.

255
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,480
We're going to receive anew.

256
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,160
Remember, he said, as often as you do it, remember me.

257
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Remember what I did on Calvary's cross.

258
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,480
But my friend today, if you don't know him, you can't take of it.

259
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,880
And if you do, it will not mean anything to you.

260
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Because in order to rejoice in it, you have to receive him and what he's done for you.

261
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,920
Do you know him?

262
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,320
If you don't, come to him today.

263
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,160
Receive him as your Savior, Lord.

264
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,640
Let us pray.

265
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:18,320
God and Heavenly Father, we are so thankful this morning for all you are and for the joy that you give within our hearts.

266
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
The blessings that are ours.

267
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:28,640
Thank you, God, for looking down upon us in our awful, sinful condition and, Lord, loving us anyway.

268
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:42,400
Thank you for, Lord, just seeing us in our helplessness and coming down, oh God, and feeling our pain and our aches, oh God, and then going to that cross and paying that debt for our sin.

269
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:57,600
And, oh God, today, if there's a person without Christ, if there's a person who is in wonder, and you know, I'm not really sure that I'm a child of God, but I see today that Jesus loved me so much, he died for me, and I want to receive him.

270
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Oh, God, may your Holy Spirit work in that heart of those hearts.

271
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,080
And may they just say yes to you.

272
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,680
Yes, Jesus, I'm a sinner.

273
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,840
Thank you for dying for me.

274
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,880
Come into my heart and save my soul.

275
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,600
Lord, that's all one needs.

276
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,720
Today do thy work in every heart in Jesus' name.

277
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,680
Amen.

278
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,000
Our hymn of invitation is number 162.

279
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,880
Are you washed in the blood?

280
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,280
Let's all stand together, shall we?

281
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,840
Jesus for the Christian.

282
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:31,120
White and snow, are you washed in the blood of the Lamb You know this morning whether or not you're watching that precious flood?

283
00:38:33,760 --> 00:49:26,400
If you are a very good friend, three, two, two, five, three, eight, five.

284
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,680
That's one eight hundred, three, two, two, five, three, eight, five.

285
00:52:43,840 --> 00:53:02,080
God people and so already knowing that mankind would become a rebellious corrupt God named those from already before he ever created the universe.

286
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:11,200
He named those whom he planned to save and he obligated himself to save these.

287
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:41,520
So at some point in their lifetime, either as a baby in the womb, a little child, or as an adult, or before they die, at some time in their lifetime, God would would have to bring them into contact with the gospel because the gospel itself, the Bible itself is the means through which God works as the Holy Spirit applies that word to the life of those that he plans to save.

288
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:54,080
And at the same time, as he brought this person into contact with this gospel, at some point in their life, as they are in contact with the gospel, it may not happen immediately.

289
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,400
They may be hear the gospel a long time before God.

290
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:06,000
But at some point, he will begin to incline their hearts.

291
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,720
He will begin to incline their will.

292
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:20,080
And they will begin to have an interest in the Bible and begin to cry to God for mercy and begin to want to be obedient to Him.

293
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,600
And that is where salvation comes from.

294
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,360
They are coming to God, but only because God is qualifying them.

295
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,840
Otherwise, they would never come to God.

296
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:54,880
You see, that's the way we talk about those who are not elected have no chance of being saved.

297
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,080
The fact is that no one deserves to be saved.

298
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,280
No one does.

299
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,520
And no one of themselves wants to become saved.

300
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,480
Think of it.

301
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:18,160
If you become a child of God, do you do your unsaved friends and do you do they say to you oh, I wish that that that Jesus was my Savior?

302
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:27,200
Yes, but no, they think that you they think that you put yourself in a straitjacket, that you can't do this, no, and you can't do that, and and so on.

303
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,720
The unsaved do not want to be saved.

304
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,560
And it has nothing to do with chance.

305
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,800
It has to do with with the with the mercy of God.

306
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:42,160
The thing I don't understand I don't understand is why did God save me?

307
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,680
Because I don't deserve it.

308
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,040
My nature, I know I would never wanted to become saved.

309
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,600
And yet God has saved me.

310
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:58,560
And yet I have saved ones who have no interest at all in the gospel.

311
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,840
Relatives who have no interest in the gospel.

312
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,600
But why did he save me?

313
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,560
I don't understand.

314
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,880
Does it mean they didn't have a chance?

315
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,400
Yes, everyone stands on the same ground before God.

316
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:18,800
And one of us has anyone else inclined my heart.

317
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,400
I don't know why God would do that.

318
00:56:51,840 --> 00:57:04,000
If I read them the Bible, that's just your interpretation.

319
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,200
That's your opinion.

320
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,080
That's just you don't know that that's what it means to things like that.

321
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:18,320
You see, everybody has to have an argument for a reason why they do not believe.

322
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,760
And that's a very common argument about your opinion.

323
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,800
I don't have to I don't have to agree with you.

324
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,160
It simply means I don't want to listen to the Bible.

325
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:50,720
One of the nice things about the text is that it language verse by verse and the language the verses that have been chosen are very plain and indicating uh what what is in view and and uh so that helps the whole lot.

326
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:59,680
But when when people want to believe we can't we can't argue with them.

327
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,960
We don't don't want to become saved because we engage in debate with them because we with them.

328
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,240
Continue with the open forms, please.

329
01:00:45,040 --> 01:01:10,800
In fact, most translations of the Bible are do not indicate this because the translators on this one but if you get a Greek English intermediate Bible, the New Testament, because the the New Testament originally was written in the Greek language, and look at the Greek words, you don't have to be a Greek scholar.

330
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:23,840
Just look at the Greek words and and you can see what is happening in a number of verses, but but one, for example, is Matthew twenty eight, verse one.

331
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:38,080
In in the King James Bible, it's in most of the Bibles it says in the end of the Sabbath, at the beginning of dawn toward the first day of the week, and Mary Magdalene and the other marriages to the sepulchre.

332
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:56,400
But in actuality, the words that are used there are the in the end of the Sabbath word in the end of the Sabbath that is there is an end to the year of some kind of a Sabbath.

333
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:12,320
As in the end is gone toward the first of the Sabbath, the word that is translated week is the identical word that is used when it says in the end of the Sabbath.

334
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:19,440
It's the identical word, and therefore it is very proper to be translated in exactly the same way.

335
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:25,600
And there are other verses that do the very same thing.

336
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:53,680
When we look at that, then we suddenly realize what God is saying that when Jesus was in the tomb, was the past of the seventh days the seventh days observance was part of the ceremonial laws, like the past, like the offering of burnt offerings, and like the offering of blood sacrifices.

337
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:10,160
Never again are we to observe those ceremonial laws in any physical way, even though we we read about them and understand that they're talking about some aspects of the gospel of the atonement.

338
01:03:10,320 --> 01:05:04,880
And we continue to look for the spiritual meaning, but we do not observe the ceremonies and when Christ was in the he was observing the last of the end of the Sabbath and it's Sunday morning and it's the first of the Sabbath and the first of these new this new Euro of Sabbath and that's why the church correctly so the street seven as the day for worship and it is the day it's it's a different sabbath altogether from the seventh day seven the seventh day seventh the big stress was no worship rest because it was a sending for rest because it was teaching the spiritual truth that we are to not work for our salvation we are to rest all together in the Lord Jesus Christ but the first day seven was the day that God himself did intense work and we are to work not physical labor in spiritual work it is the day for worship it is a day for sending forth the gospel it was on Sunday that when God raised the price from the grave it was on Sunday that God forth the Holy Spirit on Pentecost and and three thousand Sundays it was on Sunday when God began his work of creation when he said let it let there be life and and these are examples that's what we should be doing.

339
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:29,600
We ought to be observed that's the I still remember this would be the first time we were in Russia and the first time we rolled around and because I have been brought up in a homework we always observed some the other day of rest of work the many times we went to church and and uh and we we looked upon it as a very holy day.

340
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,040
What do we do today?

341
01:05:31,360 --> 01:25:22,960
So we I just go to a church someplace and then sit here in the hotel room and then know the truth and this is the day spiritual work and there's no spiritual work more we every one of the biggest things your question is concerning all of this we are very physical spiritual and everything if we have a problem because of the chemical deficiency of some points the chemical imbalance of some points in order to be in order to modify the chemical imbalance at some point that would be one thing to do the next thing to do is look at myself why do I why do I still feel the why do I feel I need why do I mean because it makes me so deeply submerged because it is such an ugly we hardly know what's what's the relationship with every human being that's the next point when we when we find myself wouldn't it be wonderful if Jesus was my sister because Jesus would be the first thing that's when we belong to absolutely faithfulness we become and and we know that it's it's we can have the speech of mind we can't we can't only have a right relationship with the points for the shelves let me read Matthew chapter five where we have these blessings blessings are the human hearts that they should see on blessing hearts the poor kingdom of heaven those who are who believe they have everything they have they don't really need they don't really need our spiritual impression we realize that that we realize that that we're under the we have to go because the these are the ones that are being these are the ones that we have to come emergency emergency words it has to be something that is rooted in the very core of my meeting oh the one thing I need is something like people secure if our trust if our based on the things of this world are wealthy that we own are maybe if that's if that's the what we're not we will not be at the point entirely complete only important you know just a whole lot of things that's nature of the importance and reflection and in order to achieve these things and yes there is something that is infinitely more important than that is my relationship that's more important than my family it's more important than my children my wife my husband it's more important than all my drugs all of these things once we have the right relationship because the I will be spending somewhere on the other side of the of the of the two points under the point we're going to be thankful for that is very very commonly I can tell you that the Bible does not teach absolutely I'm very very very familiar with the verses that people use to try to teach that and not reading the Bible carefully not reading all of the scriptures that the believers will be the last day the Bible teaches the last days that the unbelievers will be the judgment on the last days and the rapture when the when the resurrection of the of the bodies of the believers have to be the last bit and the future of that at the beginning of eighteen thirty three would always be is what would happen in the last days I believe very close to the end of the I believe that it would be the end of the it would be the thousand years in Revelation twenty figures that indicates the completeness of whatever the thousand for the completeness of God's plan which is for the time of the class until the beginning of the final tribulation period the people who are marked and that's the winning of twice one thousand years that is for the completeness of God's plans and that's a different period of time for each individual because we're all marked at different times and so on so the term one thousand years and the other period of time we would have no way of understanding twenty if that would be fun agreement with all the other passages after the completeness of the plan for the finding of the class the biblical evidence is very clear we will be losed at the beginning of the final tribulation which is more likely what happened a few years ago and that's why we have a massive increase in seasons all over the world and both in the church and outside of the church and we lose little season which is the period of the final tribulation and then when that comes to an end and that's very carefully a very careful time plan for that period of twenty three hundred eighty morning six years when that last will be the end we're going to begin the the end of time have you got the book nineteen ninety four if you if you read those books what the book is coming up with the absent from the body and and when you when you tell somebody you know we may only be months away from the end and somebody they have to think this and they don't like this they they like this world too much, they can't leave this world.

342
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:32,160
They don't like they still have to be face to think about that.

343
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:36,240
The only way they can answer that is my thing.

344
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,080
I don't agree with this book.

345
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,680
Why don't you show me from the scriptures?

346
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,760
Show me from the Bible.

347
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,480
Because the Bible finally is the testimony.

348
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,440
This is where we have to check everything else.

349
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,600
No, I don't think so.

350
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:36,080
I think the best thing to do is look at the versus many of them because the face of those verses and what does this mean that Christ will be resurrected the last days.

351
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,200
What does this mean?

352
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,920
What does this mean?

353
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,800
Matthew twenty four, verse twenty nine.

354
01:26:54,480 --> 01:27:02,800
Immediately after the tribulation of the face of the sound of the doctrine of the sound of the false and so on.

355
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:19,760
In other words, I I you I'm ready to face these verses and give very harmonious answers to it answers that are harmonious with the rest of the gospel.

356
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,360
Let me try to do it from this point of view.

357
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,480
Let the Bible be the testing.

358
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,160
Let's let's let him try to work through the scriptures.

359
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,600
This is talking about the believers.

360
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,360
We have experienced the first resurrection.

361
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:16,240
And we have been raised with Christ with Christ raised with the resurrection.

362
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,240
We have been raised.

363
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,640
And we have experienced the resurrection.

364
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:32,640
We receive our brand new spiritual spirit.

365
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:37,520
We in our soul existence we have the eternal life.

366
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:44,720
That's why when we die, without any further change, we can go instantly into God's holy presence.

367
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:50,080
Our bodies have not experienced the resurrection.

368
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:57,200
That's why the Bible talks about us being raised on the last day.

369
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,320
That's that's the resurrection of our body.

370
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,200
We've experienced the first resurrection.

371
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,560
We are holy like we read in Second Peter chapter one.

372
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,520
We are holy priests.

373
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,760
We are a holy priesthood of God.

374
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,000
We are priests of God.

375
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,800
That's the second death of eternal damnation.

376
01:29:53,520 --> 01:30:00,720
All God cannot come against us because we have eternal life and we reign with Christ.

377
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,600
We are thrown in heaven.

378
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,800
We are seated with him in principle in heaven.

379
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:20,240
We are thus described.

380
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,720
Thank you for sharing this message.

381
01:30:51,600 --> 01:31:00,240

386

For more information, you may call PCB at 1-800-366-049.

387
01:31:49,120 --> 01:32:39,920
Your tendency listener supported WTDS tendency to discuss the continuing form, please.

388
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:29,360
We have to read this very, very carefully and then it all begins to make sense.

389
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:41,840
And first Corinthians thirteen and verse eighty six whether there be prophecies they shall fail.

390
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:50,720
Whether there be tongues, they shall see prophecies they shall fail.

391
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,520
It's a different word than it used for tongues, they shall see.

392
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,600
Whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away.

393
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,720
The Bible does not show it's the word that is used.

394
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,680
Knowledge it shall vanish away.

395
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,880
It's the same one that is used for prophecy.

396
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:38,560
Knowledge and prophesying all the tongues will speak and we can't tell someone else to the mind.

397
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:28,080
That which is impossible knowledge and prophesying knowledge and prophesies will be done away.

398
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:48,480
I know I know even a full I know.

399
01:35:49,200 --> 01:36:16,240
In other words, the important knowledge of today will be will be a full knowledge when I come face to face with the Lord and and all of us come face to face with the Lord when we are face for that is when when we die and want to be with the Lord for on the last day when he comes.

400
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:23,680
If we're going to be at the time and we that is when the person comes.

401
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:49,920
Okay, if we speak one other time if we believe in the tongue and we believe that God is still bringing Revelation according to Revelation twenty two verse eighteen, we are not a child of God.

402
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:58,880
Because the Bible says if anyone adds to the words of the prophecy of this I will add him the place of the period.

403
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:09,120
In all the churches they talk about free will, but they also talk about by grace alone have we become saved.

404
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,360
They don't realize that that's a contradiction in truth.

405
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:44,400
That the untrue believers in these churches they are trusting that they're saved by grace alone, even though they have been taught someone holds the position I am saved because I have done this and that and this was the requirement in order for me to become safe.

406
01:37:45,120 --> 01:38:07,600
We may have a different kind of a thought because we are still under the breath of God because we cannot be safe if we're trusting in a word that we have done our trust to be entirely in what concept even though we may still have faulty doctrine concerning them.

407
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:30,960
Thank you for calling me and shall we take on this call, please welcome I would like to ask your advice and your opinion on the matter thinking about the church.

408
01:38:32,560 --> 01:39:00,400
We are trying to become members of the church and part of the process we understand that well first of all the church that there are standards for Westminster Confession and the Catechism and we're going to be required to answer yes to these questions at our children's baptism.

409
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,120
And one of the questions is promise to God, Mr.

410
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,320
Powell to God.

411
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:21,280
They're going to ask us if we promise to instruct our children in the principles of our holy religion as revealed in the scriptures of the Old and New Testament.
