1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,600
Chapter 2, verses 9 and 10 of our text.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:12,800
And today, certainly this song was conducive to our message: the everlasting bliss of the saved.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
And what a wonderful thing Christians have to look forward to.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:33,280
What a tremendous feeling it should give in the heart of every child of God today to know that your destiny and what it's going to be in the everlasting presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and all the saints of God.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:45,600
Again, but as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,120
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,320
For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Just to contemplate upon the gracious goodness of our God, just to think about the provisions that God has made for the future estate of his children, is to make the heart leap with joy.

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,720
Christian friend, do you daily look up to God in thanksgiving and praise, rejoicing over all that you have in him?

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:32,400
I do not mean merely the current things that we have every day, like his present salvation, for his grace and his mercy and his protection and his love and his care.

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,720
But I mean, Christian friends, do you thank God daily for those things that are not yet tangible?

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Those things that you can't yet get a hold of, those things that you can't touch right now?

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,760
Are you thankful to him for that?

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,240
But they're ours through the promises that are revealed unto us, the Bible says, by his Spirit.

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:06,960
I have not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit.

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:17,040
You know, if you're not a Christian today, you cannot understand, nor can you appreciate that that is provided in Jesus Christ for his own.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,920
Furthermore, the things of the Spirit and spiritual provisions are foolishness, the Bible says, in your sight.

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:40,800
Furthermore, and then the Bible says this, but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can ye know them because they are spiritually discerned.

19
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,480
If you're a Christian today, your heart will leap as we proceed with this study.

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:56,320
And if you're an older Christian today, your heart will take a double leap because you're closer to that everlasting bliss with God.

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:09,760
How we will, we will not speculate today on what we might have throughout eternity, but we will confine ourselves to what we have revealed in God's word of what we shall have throughout eternity.

22
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,040
You know, truly, what God has prepared for those who love him outdistances human imagination altogether.

23
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,640
We cannot fathom what God has in store for us.

24
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:35,120
We cannot imagine it, but our key verses remind us that God graciously gives us glimpses of the provision he has made for us by the gracious and glorious ministry of the Holy Spirit.

25
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Perhaps we haven't understood, and I'm sure we don't, the real and understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God that lives within our hearts day by day.

26
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
But we're going to see today something of his ministry and his work.

27
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,640
Notice again the title we've given to this message today, The Everlasting Bliss of the Saved.

28
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,880
In this title, there are three very important words that we should observe.

29
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
And first of all, we notice the word saved.

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
What does it tell us?

31
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,600
This describes the present position, then the future destiny of every true Christian.

32
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Romans chapter 10 and verses 9 and 10 says, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

33
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,640
For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.

34
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,920
In Ephesians chapter 2, verses 8 through 10, we're told, For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.

35
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,680
It is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,480
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.

37
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,480
This has to do, the bliss that we have, is for the saved.

38
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
It's for the saved.

39
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
Notice the second word, bliss, or perhaps a better word would be blessedness.

40
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,320
For the true child of God, the past, the present, and the future situation is one of blessedness.

41
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:18,560
So far as the past is concerned, Psalms 32, 1 says, Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered.

42
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,520
That ought to make your heart leap to realize that our past is all gone.

43
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,560
It's covered under the precious blood of Calvary's cross.

44
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
We're his forever, to be in his presence forever.

45
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,680
Then we go on, and so far as the present is concerned, the Bible tells us, oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,320
Blessed is the man who trusteth in him.

47
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
That's present.

48
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Taste and see that the Lord is good.

49
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,960
Trust in him as your personal Savior and Lord, and know his blessedness.

50
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
And then also we look at the future.

51
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:06,000
So far as the future is concerned, the word says, then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

52
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,920
God prepared it way back before the foundation of the world.

53
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
God prepared all this for those that are his.

54
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,840
Day by day, we can rejoice in this.

55
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,680
The third important word in the title of this message today is the word everlasting.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:36,640
Listen, the prospect of the Christian is blessed indeed because it is the prospect of a blessedness that shall never, never, never end.

57
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
It's for eternity.

58
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:47,520
And as long as God shall be, the redeemed of all the ages will live to enjoy unending blessings.

59
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,600
Now the question is this, of what will the future blessedness of the saved consist?

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,600
The Bible has the answers.

61
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,880
First of all, it will be the blessedness of being forever with the Lord.

62
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:12,000
John 14, 3 says, Jesus said, and if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again to receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be always.

63
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:22,800
1 Thessalonians 4, 17 says, Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

64
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Hallelujah, what a Savior.

65
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:35,600
The chief attraction of our future blessedness is that we shall be with the Lord who loved us and gave himself for us.

66
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Not with a stranger, but with he who loves us.

67
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
Paul said, I am crucified with Christ.

68
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,840
Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

69
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,680
And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

70
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:06,240
This is the blessedness to be forever with the Lord who loved us, who loved us before the foundation of the world, but today who loves us by his grace and by his mercy.

71
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:24,080
But let us not be quite clear today, friends, that only those who love him, only those who believe on him, only those who serve him now will want to be with him and will, in fact, be with him then and eternity.

72
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
Do you love Jesus, my friends?

73
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,080
Do you know him as your Savior?

74
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,160
Then how are you showing it?

75
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,040
Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

76
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,640
And Peter said, Lord, yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.

77
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,600
And Jesus said unto him, feed my sheep.

78
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,880
Feed my sheep.

79
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,920
Where is that love?

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Where is that service?

81
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
Do you believe on him?

82
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,960
Then where is the evidence of your confidence and your joy and your satisfaction and your delight and your service?

83
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:05,840
The Bible says, he that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

84
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,240
Do you serve him, my friend?

85
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,280
Then where is the fruit in the testimony of your labor?

86
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,640
1 Thessalonians chapter 1 and verse 9, it tells us there.

87
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:28,160
For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.

88
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:44,560
Jesus is saying here, here in the now, for those who are the saved, there will be the blessedness of being forever with the Lord Jesus.

89
00:09:44,880 --> 00:10:06,400
Here in the now, the present, dear Christian friends, our dear Lord is with us, as Isaiah the prophet so clearly reminds us in chapter 43 and verse chapter 43 and verse 2 says, When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.

90
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,720
When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

91
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:24,160
And also in Hebrews chapter 13 in verses 5 and 6, it says, Let your manner of life be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have.

92
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:34,400
For he that have said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

93
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,800
We have this blessedness of being with him forever, and we have his protection, and he will never leave us nor forsake us.

94
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,440
So now he is with us.

95
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:54,480
But then we shall be with him, and our personal Savior, the one who shed his blood for us, our friend and our master.

96
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,800
Jesus said, if any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my servant be.

97
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
If any man serve me, him will my father honor.

98
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
What a consolation.

99
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:16,400
What a precious joy it is to the Christian soul today to know that Jesus is with us.

100
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:25,120
But then, out there, for the saved, there is the blessedness of being forever with the Lord.

101
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,920
Secondly, what is the future blessedness of the saved?

102
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,000
It will be the blessedness of conformity to the likeness of our Lord Jesus Christ.

103
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:46,080
1 John 3, 1, 2 tells us that we shall not only be with Christ, but wonder of wonders, we shall be like him.

104
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
We're very unlike him now.

105
00:11:48,800 --> 00:12:10,720
We cannot imagine ourselves robed in this old sinful flesh and with the sinful actions and with selfishness and jealousy and many times unloveliness and unkindness as being very much like Jesus our Lord, even though we have been saved by his mercy and his grace.

106
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:25,040
On this side of heaven, we are very much unlike him now in so many ways, but then, because we are saved by his grace, when we shall see him, we shall be like him as he is.

107
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,520
Oh, thank God.

108
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,520
Thank God for his saving grace.

109
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:45,280
Thank God for his transforming power that changes us from darkness to light and changes this old foul body and this old foul mind, foul mind of ungodliness and makes us free in him.

110
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,440
And one day it shall be fulfilled and the fruition is out there in the future when God shall take us home to be with him forever.

111
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,480
Oh, that should make Baptist shout.

112
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,440
To shout, to know that we're his and to be with him for all eternity in his presence.

113
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,840
Do you want to see Jesus?

114
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,560
I want to see him because that's my prize.

115
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:27,280
I'm going to be like him out of self and out of what I am, out of my fallacies and out of my failures and conformed to his blessed image.

116
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
This is God's program for every one of his children.

117
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:43,920
For Romans 8, 29 says, for whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

118
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,720
And Psalm 17, verse 15 says, As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness.

119
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,520
I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.

120
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:03,600
Beloved of God, the Bible tells us we are actually going to have a body like that of our Lord.

121
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
A body like his.

122
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:14,800
1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 20 says, But now in Christ is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept.

123
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:28,400
And in Philippians chapter 3 and verses 20 and 21, it says, For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

124
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:43,040
Listen, who shall change our lowly body, that it may be fashioned like his glorious body, according to the workings by which he is able even to subdue all things unto himself?

125
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,440
No, my friends, we shall not be angels as you might have thought sometime in your life.

126
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,560
No, we shall not be disembodied spirits floating around in space.

127
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:06,080
No, we shall not be reincarnations hopping around like rabbits and so on, like this New Age mess and garbage tells us today.

128
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:17,600
No, my friends, let me tell you, we have been called of God, and we shall be those whom the Lord has called and justified and who now have been glorified.

129
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,800
This is what the Bible tells us in Romans chapter 8.

130
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:36,400
Romans chapter 8 and verse 30, it says, Moreover, whom he did predestinate, all before the foundation of the world, you were predestinated in him, my friend, to be his child.

131
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,440
Then he also called.

132
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
Those whom he did predestinate, them he also called.

133
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,960
You see, he predestinates us.

134
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,640
He knows before the foundation of the world, we're predestinated in him, but he also calls us.

135
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,120
And we respond by faith and trust in the precious Lord Jesus Christ and his finished work on Calvary.

136
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:09,120
And whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

137
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,720
Thirdly, the future blessedness of the saved will be the blessedness of living in perfect surroundings.

138
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,560
Won't that be wonderful?

139
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,600
Praise the Lord.

140
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Won't it be wonderful to get out of this old environment of corruption and sin?

141
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,680
Our first parents were placed in the paradise, and Maya, what a marvelous place it was.

142
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,640
We read about it in Genesis chapter 2.

143
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,480
But then we read that sin and the curse came in and paradise was lost.

144
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:52,080
And thus destruction and sorrow and sin of every description under the authority of the prince and the power of the air took its toll.

145
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
You know who the prince and the power of the air is?

146
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
Satan.

147
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,840
It took its toll.

148
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,560
He was under all this, all this, the prince in the power of the air, he is ruling.

149
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:15,440
That's why he comes in and he brings you to task and he gets on your shoulder and he tells you all this stuff, you know, and people yield to it, the temptations.

150
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,640
He's the prince in the power of the air, and when man fell in sin, he took over.

151
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:31,840
Until one day, thank God, through our Lord's coming and his perfect finished work on Calvary's cross, paradise has been regained.

152
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
Hallelujah to the king.

153
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,440
And every Christian now looks forward to a new world of order.

154
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,280
Oh, no, not a new world order.

155
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,840
But he looks to a new world of order in place of the present world of disorder and disruption and chaos.

156
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:08,320
Oh, my friends, when the new world order comes in of the Lord Jesus, it won't be like the new world order that the fallacies and the finite man tries to bring about.

157
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,440
It'll be a place of contentment.

158
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,640
It'll be a place of peace.

159
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,640
It'll be a place that is ordered by the Lord Jesus.

160
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,520
You see, this is our eternal bliss.

161
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,680
We're going to be in his presence under his leadership.

162
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,560
There's no hymn that speaks of a land of pure delight and how perfectly right this is.

163
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,760
It is a land where we will never grow old.

164
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:51,040
The Bible says in Revelation chapter 7 and verses 16 and 17, they shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

165
00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:01,840
For the Lamb who is the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them into living fountains of water, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

166
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Such glories as God has prepared for his children are impossible of description in any other language than that which the Holy Spirit has chosen to describe the blessedness of our heavenly home.

167
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:21,840
Today, when you go home, you take your Bible and you turn over to chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation.

168
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,440
Chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation and read about the wonderful description of our eternal home.

169
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
And you live will come back tonight shouting.

170
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,680
Are you, my friend, this day on your way to that land of perfect surroundings?

171
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,360
That place where there is no more problems, but in the presence of Jesus Christ.

172
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,720
Jesus said, My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish.

173
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,840
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

174
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:05,200
Looking, Father, the wonderful blessedness of the saved will be the blessedness of freedom from all earth's limitations.

175
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
Ah, there will be nothing that will limit us there.

176
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,320
Oh, here we are so limited, and we're confined, and we're cramped.

177
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:29,360
In fact, we groan to be free from earth's limitations, its tensions, its pressures, its stresses, its temptations, its burdens.

178
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:44,640
From Romans chapter 8 and verses 22 to 23, we read these words, For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

179
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:59,200
And not only they, but ourselves also who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, that the redemption, that is the redemption of our body.

180
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,040
Oh, we are here in this world of chaos and sin and corruption and limitations.

181
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
And we groan in our spirit, we who know Jesus Christ.

182
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,480
And we long for that day when God receives us unto himself.

183
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,640
We're adopted into the family of God, and we long for the redemption of that body.

184
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400
A glorified body.

185
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,320
A purified body.

186
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,960
Not limited by the flesh.

187
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:39,840
We all know that sin is a terrible limitation, but we who are already freed from its penalty, having passed from death unto life through faith in Jesus Christ, may also daily be free from the power as God's word ensures us.

188
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,520
In Romans 8, 2, we read, For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death.

189
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
We're living in a world where sin is rampant.

190
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,960
And because we are in the weaknesses of the old flesh, we fell through temptation.

191
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:09,360
But by God's mercy and his grace through faith in him and his finished work, we have been freed from the penalty of sin and by the Spirit of life in Christ living in us.

192
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,320
Ah, this keeps us from living in bondage and under the power of sin day by day.

193
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, that makes me joyous aside.

194
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:28,560
That I'm not under the power of Satan on this earth, but Christ living in me has delivered me from the power of sin day by day.

195
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
We have the victory because we're in Jesus Christ.

196
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:43,360
And then out there beyond that blessed future with God, his children shall be freed altogether from the very presence of sin.

197
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,080
Let's read Revelation chapter 21 and verse 27.

198
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,760
And it says here, and there shall in no way enter into it anything that defile it.

199
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:04,000
Neither he that worketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

200
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Folks, the devil's not going to be there.

201
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,560
There's nothing going to defile it.

202
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,920
And only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life are going to be there.

203
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,800
We're all aware today that the devil is very active indeed.

204
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,480
But one day the Bible says he's going to be bound and cast in the lake of fire forever.

205
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,040
Revelation chapter 20 and verse 10.

206
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,600
On this earth, while we're in the body, we find that our bodies give us a great deal of trouble.

207
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,360
We experience sickness.

208
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
We experience weakness.

209
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
We experience pain and discomfort.

210
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
But all this is going to be changed.

211
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,720
It's all going to be changed.

212
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:51,760
In heaven, there will be no more tears, no more death, no more sorrow, no more crying, and no more pain.

213
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
Revelation 21, 4.

214
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:03,440
Are you looking and longing for that glorious day and hour when you shall be free from all of Earth's limitations?

215
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
How great the prospect is.

216
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,720
Do you anticipate that glorious exodus to your heavenly home, leaving Earth's limitations behind?

217
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,920
The Apostle Paul longed for heaven and home.

218
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,000
He said, for me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

219
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:34,640
And then in Philippians chapter 1, in verses 23 and 25, he went on from that place and he said, for I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.

220
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:47,360
Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you, and having this confidence, I know I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith.

221
00:24:47,680 --> 00:25:00,240
God kept him here in order to stir within us the joy and the desire and the furtherance of joy and faith in him that we too might have that desire.

222
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh, my friend, do you have a desire to be with Jesus?

223
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,600
Our desire for Jesus to come, to come in his fullness and his likeness.

224
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,040
I wish he'd come today.

225
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,560
What is your desire this morning?

226
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
Is it heaven?

227
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:26,720
In the fifth place, the Bible tells us that the bliss of the saved will be the blessedness of fellowship with the redeemed of all the ages.

228
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:48,720
Sometimes after we've had a time of glorious fellowship, when we've had a great high, spiritual high, young fellows, when we've had that opportunity that God has just filled us full of himself, and we feel his presence, sometime wherein the people we say this, it's been a foretaste of glory.

229
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,640
And how true it is.

230
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,560
This is the truth of the matter.

231
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,840
One day we shall meet with all the saints of all the ages.

232
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:09,680
The Old Testament saints, the New Testament saints, the early Christians, the martyrs, the reformers, the Puritans, and right on down to our present day, we shall meet together with all those who've trusted him.

233
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:22,480
And as we look upon the sin and the corruption and the downward trend and the chaotic condition of the world, without doubt we may assume that hell will be running over with the lost and unrepentant sinners.

234
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,640
And my friends, there will be a lot there.

235
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
But oh, let me tell you something.

236
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,200
Beloved, in heaven, heaven's not going to be an empty place.

237
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,280
Heaven's not going to be an empty place.

238
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:48,560
We're told this in Luke chapter 13 and verse 29 tells us, and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

239
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,640
My, what a company will be gathered in the courts of the Lord.

240
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:02,800
But best of all, perhaps, for this touches us most intimately, our slaved loved ones will be with us.

241
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,640
And we shall be with them.

242
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,920
Oh, what kind of relationship we shall have with them, surely God in heaven only knows.

243
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,400
But let us make no mistake about it.

244
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
We shall recognize our loved ones.

245
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,600
Of course we will.

246
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:25,120
Just as we will, as much as we will recognize Peter and Paul and Jesus, most of all.

247
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,120
We shall recognize all the seats of God.

248
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,880
We shall recognize our loved ones.

249
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,120
And God makes sure that we understand this from 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 12.

250
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,800
1 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 12, listen.

251
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,400
For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then, face to face.

252
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,600
Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known.

253
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm going to know my loved ones.

254
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,240
I'm going to know every one of you that's been washed in the precious blood of Calvary's cross.

255
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,920
And you're going to know me.

256
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:20,320
Finally, this morning, may we see that the future bliss of the saved will be the blessedness of engaging in the service of the King and worshiping Him in unhindered worship.

257
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,920
You know, as born-again children of God, certainly here and now, we're engaged in His service.

258
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,840
But in eternity, in redeemed bodies, we are to serve Him forever.

259
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:41,120
Revelation 22, 3 says, And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.

260
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,520
And all our service here on this earth now is a preparation for then.

261
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:58,000
And we know this because from Matthew's gospel and the parable of the talents, we're told his Lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant.

262
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,080
Thou hast been faithful over a few things.

263
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,160
I will make thee rule over many things.

264
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,120
Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.

265
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:16,320
So we recognize that our faithfulness in the work of the Lord here on this earth qualifies for authority and responsibility there.

266
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,880
You know, in this old body, we get tired, don't we?

267
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,880
And we get down, and we get sometimes depressed because we get weary and tired.

268
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:34,800
We also know that when we serve the Lord here on this earth, oftentimes we get tired in his service.

269
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,560
But we never get tired of serving.

270
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,640
We never get tired of serving.

271
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,560
But in eternity, we shall know no tiredness.

272
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,120
And at the same time, let us realize that we will be in the full service of the king.

273
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:02,480
We should never imagine that in heaven we shall be sitting with folded arms and folded hands or sitting on a cloud playing a harp.

274
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,080
But we shall be serving and worshiping him unhindered.

275
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
Nothing in the way.

276
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:22,240
What rapture will it be prostrate before thy throne to be and gaze and gaze on thee.

277
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,040
This expresses the true nature of worship.

278
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,680
It is the love and the adoration of yielded and grateful hearts.

279
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,440
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

280
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,160
When we all see Jesus, we shall sing and shout the victory.

281
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,080
Hallelujah to the King, the Lord of lords and king of kings.

282
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,280
Here in this life, we meet to worship the Lord and we meet amid weakness.

283
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:18,160
We meet amid interruptions and diversions and oftentimes our praise is feeble and our hearts lag and our minds are dull and our memories are weak and sometimes there are jarring notes and wandering thoughts.

284
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,280
But how different it will be when we're gathered in his presence forevermore.

285
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
Oh my friend, do you know Jesus today?

286
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
Are you one of his?

287
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,480
Do you long for heaven and home?

288
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:43,200
For you see, this is our eternal bliss forever in his presence.

289
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,280
And today, my friend, if you are a child of God, you can rejoice with great rejoicing.

290
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,880
You can expound in Christ your joy and your thankfulness.

291
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:13,040
But my friend, if you know not Jesus Christ today, if you've never come to a place in your life to say, Lord, I am a sinner, I'm lost, no such joy can be yours.

292
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,240
No such rejoicing can be yours.

293
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,960
No such hope can be yours.

294
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,000
There's nothing to look forward to but an eternity without God.

295
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:36,160
Separated from Him for eternity in the very presence of the devil and sin and torment.

296
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,280
An eternal separation from eternity.

297
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,400
Oh, what a miserable, miserable, miserable.

298
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,400
We cannot express it in words.

299
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,800
It would be to be separated from God forever.

300
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,080
Oh, if you know not Christ today, I pray you.

301
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:10,320
I am hell upon you to come and say, Lord Jesus, I want to say that I need you in my life, and I want to come and I want to ask you just to begin my sin and come into my heart and say my soul.

302
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,920
He said, Do it.

303
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Him that come unto me, I will know what I'm casting.

304
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,160
I'll take you.

305
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,040
Those he also predestinated, he also called.

306
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,880
Are you one of those today that's morning to come to Jesus?

307
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,760
Just come down that aisle.

308
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,000
It's good for you to do that.

309
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,480
In our invitation on Him, it's good for you to come to do that because you've sinned the world.

310
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,400
You've sinned all those around you.

311
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm placing my stake with Jesus Christ.

312
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm placing my eternity in His hands to spend it with Him.

313
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,840
Would you come today and take my hand and give God your heart?

314
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,960
And I'll take the Word of God and I'll put it to Jesus Christ.

315
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,480
Come today, the opportunity is yours.

316
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,440
Do you want to enjoy the bliss of heaven for all eternity?

317
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,120
Do you want to be in His presence?

318
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,600
The only way you can do it is come.

319
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,800
The Bible says that you must be born again.

320
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,120
Read the third chapter of the book of John.

321
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
Let me tell you all about it.

322
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,480
How you can be born again and his kingdom cleansed by his power.

323
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,040
Will you do it today?

324
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,000
Will you come?

325
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,760
Will you take him as you say?

326
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,840
Trust him.

327
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,440
Our God and our Father today, we just thank you for your great love.

328
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,400
We just thank you for loving us and cared so much for us.

329
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,440
Undeserving as we are, Lord, you loved us.

330
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,920
And you paid that price on Calvary for us.

331
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,640
Willingly, voluntarily, not because you had to, but because you cared.

332
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,840
And because you love us today, and you say, come unto me.

333
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,320
All ye that labor and are heavy laden, I'll give you rest.

334
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,520
I'll give you peace.

335
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,040
I'll give you joy.

336
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,320
Oh, God, speak to the heart right now, O Lord, who needs you so.

337
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,000
In your precious name we pray.

338
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:22,960
Amen.

339
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
Our song of invitation this morning is number 259.

340
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,920
I mean, 192.

341
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,120
Nail scarred hand.

342
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,960
Let me say, dear friend, again, would you come this morning to read the Lord?

343
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
And his face will be blessed according to his will and his purpose in his life.

344
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,520
Make us to the reading, of his word, makers blessing to the reading of his precious word today.

345
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,600
God bless you, and God bless you real good.

346
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,280
Let me see.

347
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,400
I've done a lot of talking.

348
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,400
Let's see if I've got a token on here for.

349
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,360
See.
