1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,840
Is lost in sin.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,080
But they must cause something to cause that person to desire to be saved.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,560
What must I do to be saved?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,320
The question you see this morning is not what good thing shall I do?

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,920
For there's not one good thing that anyone can do that will merit salvation.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,640
The Bible says, For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
It is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:54,160
Not by one good thing, not by one good thing, not by any works, not by anything of ourselves, are we saved, but by what we do.

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,480
Now what is it that we do?

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,840
Verse 31 tells us, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thy house.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,640
You see, by God's long-suffering mercy and His glorious unmerited favor, we are saved through faith.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,840
I asked the question today, are you saved, my friend?

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,440
Are you saved?

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:32,960
In Acts chapter 16 and verses 14 to 34, we have the red of three conversions, that of Lydia, the seller of purple, that of a certain damsel, and that of the jailer of the prison at Philippi.

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:47,920
If we view these three cases of conversion as they are presented to us in this chapter, we learn that the gospel is relevant to and adequate to all kinds and conditions of people.

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:02:01,680
Lydia was quite different from the damsel, and these two ladies were totally different from the jailer, and yet the gospel met the needs of each one of them.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,120
For Romans 10, verses 12 and 13, we have the words like this, For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek.

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
For the same Lord overall is rich unto all that call upon him.

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

20
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:30,960
We also learned that from the Word of God, the Lord's methods in seeking and saving men and women vary according to a person's concern.

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,680
God deals with different people in different ways.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,840
He dealt with the woman at the well differently than he might deal with someone else.

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
There are people that come to know the Lord on their own.

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,680
I know of one lady who found the Lord out in a cow pasture as she knelt as God's Holy Spirit spoke to her about her life.

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,320
And she knelt behind an old stump and asked Jesus Christ to come in her heart.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,160
God deals with people in his own way in different ways.

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,320
Lydia, preserably, you see, was an educated woman, sophisticated, prudent.

28
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,200
Her conversion was a quiet one.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
The jailer, on the other hand, was a pretty tough man.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
And he was converted rather noisily.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,600
And then the damsel had a great struggle, it seems, before she came through into the experience of salvation.

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
But you see, they were all saved.

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,520
This morning, let us concentrate upon one experience, that of the jailer.

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,200
In order for us to gain the fullest significance of this tremendous question that we're asked by the jailer, what must I do to be saved?

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,080
It will help us to notice three stages in the process of his entrance into the Christian life.

36
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
First of all, let us observe the jailer's conviction.

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,120
You see, the sinner first has to be convicted of his sin.

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
What caused him to fill his need?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,800
You who know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior today know that nobody ever turns to the Lord for salvation until he first fills his need to be saved.

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
This is the reason that many people do not come to Jesus Christ.

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,600
They do not feel their need of him.

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,520
After all, we only go to the doctor when we feel ill.

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
Is that right?

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:43,760
Aren't you glad today, dear saved ones, that God, by his almighty love and grace and spirit, made you feel the illness of your sins?

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,920
Aren't you glad that God showed us the rottenness of our sex and our deserved place?

46
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:03,120
But then in his long-suffering mercy, he reached down and he lifted us and he gave us knowledge and sense enough to fill our need of the Savior.

47
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:12,000
You know, certain things happened to make this tough, rough, talking, doubtless, callous jailer to feel his need of the Savior.

48
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,360
And these happenings produced within him a sense of conviction.

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,280
First of all, the praises of Paul and Silas convinced the jailer of the reality of divine things.

50
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:34,400
Verse 25 in our scripture says, And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God, and the prisoners heard them.

51
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Paul and Silas during this time, understand, were suffering great hardships, both physically and mentally.

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:54,880
You see, in verses 22 through 23 and 24, it says, And the multitudes rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded to beat them.

53
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:12,800
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into the prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely, who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
You know, he wasn't going to get himself in trouble.

55
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:28,960
He said, you know, if he had, he put them in the inner prison, he made their feet put stalks upon them, because had he let those prisoners escape, you know what would happen to him?

56
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,240
No way.

57
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,920
But here Paul and Silas were in suffering.

58
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,760
They had all this beating upon them.

59
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,120
They had these stalks on them.

60
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,520
But you know, they didn't stay in there and moan and complain.

61
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:57,040
In the midst of this experiencing these hardships, they were praising God and praying to him, and their testimony for Jesus Christ didn't fade away in their moaning complaints.

62
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,320
The fact of the two men praising the Lord in the midst of their trials influenced this jailer very greatly.

63
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,200
Dear saints of God, this day is no different than that time.

64
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,120
For when Christians react to suffering in the right way, the unconverted are going to take notice.

65
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,600
And they're going to be greatly influenced.

66
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:32,160
You might think today, well, and we have such a nonchalant society and unconcerned people, people aren't going to pay much attention to Christians, who are Christians anyway.

67
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,600
Suffering, don't mark that off.

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,760
Because people observe you whether you realize it or not.

69
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:50,320
And if we are suffering in the right way and have the right attitude and have praises on our lips, God is going to influence others with it.

70
00:07:50,640 --> 00:08:02,640
In Philippians chapter 1 and verse 2, the apostle said, But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the furthest of the gospel.

71
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,600
The testimony we live for Jesus Christ will influence someone along the way.

72
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,120
Some of you have heard this illustration, but let us hear it again concerning our influence to others.

73
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
There was a young man.

74
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,320
He often went to see an elderly gentleman to tell him about Christ because he had a burden for this man.

75
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,160
And he'd go and he'd talk with him and he'd pray with him and he'd plead with him.

76
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
And one day the old man said, son, it is not how many times you've come.

77
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
It's not how much you've talked.

78
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,120
It's not how much you've prayed.

79
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,720
But it's the life that you've lived that causes me to see I need Jesus Christ.

80
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,280
His consistency, his living for the Lord, over and over had an influence upon this man.

81
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
Secondly, what convicted this jailer?

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,720
The earthquake and the fear that this brought upon the jailer caused him to think about God and about his spiritual need.

83
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:18,800
Verses 26 and 27 in our scripture tell us this, And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loosed.

84
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:29,680
And the keeper of the prison, waking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew out his sword and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

85
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,600
But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.

86
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,760
Here was a careless, thoughtless, irreligious man.

87
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,760
Suddenly he was shaken by an earthquake and faced with imminent death.

88
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,520
He pulled out his sword.

89
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
He would have killed himself because all these people were gone.

90
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
But Paul cried out, we're all here.

91
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,080
All this awoke him to his need.

92
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,680
And he was facing eternity and he was unprepared to die.

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,920
You know, there are some people today who need an earthquake before they will feel their need of the Savior.

94
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:22,720
And oftentimes the Lord graciously permits an earthquake to shake them out of their complacency and to cause them to feel how desperately they need to be saved.

95
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,960
Certainly most of us, if not all of us, have never experienced the devastation of an earthquake.

96
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,960
While living out in the state of Illinois, my wife and I experienced only a small earth tremor.

97
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,840
And while no one was injured, however, this small earthquake was enough to shake 18 states.

98
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,960
It was enough to make the house feel like it was crawling.

99
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,920
It was enough to make the windows rattle and the things hanging on the walls to swing back and forth like a pendulum.

100
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:07,040
It was enough to cause my wife and I to bow our heads and hearts before God and thank Him for His love and protection and safety for us.

101
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:18,640
You know today someone might perhaps think, but why would a gracious God allow a terrible earthquake and permit disaster and death and sorrow?

102
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:31,280
My friends, oftentimes God has to permit these catastrophes today in order to open some blinded eyes to the awful, devastating, eternal effects of sin.

103
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
You see, eternity is forever.

104
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,640
And sin must be paid for forever.

105
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:49,040
And the only way God can get a hold of some hearts because of their callousness and their ungodliness and their ongoing in sin is to bring a catastrophe.

106
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:59,760
And oh, my friends, there may be many catastrophes in this world before people come to Him.

107
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,640
Sometimes God even has to bring a catastrophe in the family, even of Christians.

108
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,960
Because Christians grow so cold and indifferent and nonchalant and unconcerned and unfaithful to the house of God.

109
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,760
And God has to get over their hearts.

110
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,080
And He has to shake them in order to bring them to that place of recommitment of themselves to Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
There's some in our church who needs a shaking.

112
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:50,240
You know, as sinners outside of Jesus Christ could only visualize, could only experience a small portion of the eternal, destructive, fearful, suffering effects of sin and a burning hell, how many there would be who would run to get to the feet of Jesus.

113
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:08,400
Our God and our Savior wants to convince sinners like this jailer here and there and around the world of sin and its eternal destiny, that they might repent and see their need of the Savior and come to Him before it's too late.

114
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,160
This Philippian jailer was shaken to the reality of his need.

115
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,960
Dear friend, here today, have you been shaken by the convicting power of God's Holy Spirit in your heart?

116
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:30,240
Thirdly, now notice the attitude of Paul and Silas after the earthquake convinced this jailer that these men were real Christians.

117
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,520
Verse 27 and 28 tell us that the jailer expected that Paul and Silas and the other prisoners would have fled.

118
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:48,800
But in actual fact, Paul and Silas at any rate were still there waiting to be of service to this man and to lead him into the kingdom.

119
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
Here were prisoners actually helping their own jailer.

120
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,200
Is that what prisoners are doing today?

121
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
They're breaking out and killing him.

122
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
Everywhere we hear about this all the time.

123
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
Here were these prisoners helping their own jailer.

124
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,360
Here were good men indeed.

125
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,000
Thus we see the jailer and was brought under a deep sense of conviction of his need of salvation.

126
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,360
And this was so great that it caused him to cry out in anguish and haste, what must I do to be saved?

127
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,120
And surely if anyone ever wanted to know how to be saved, this man did.

128
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,280
Do you feel any such need in your life?

129
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
If you're not a Christian today, let me tell you folks, you're lost.

130
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,480
But in Luke chapter 19 and verse 10, we're told that the Son of Man has come to seeking to save that which is lost.

131
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,760
If you're not a Christian today, the Bible says that you're dead in trespasses and sins.

132
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,960
But by your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, our God will make you alive in Him.

133
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,240
My friend, if you are not a Christian today, the eternal wrath and condemnation of Almighty God abides upon you.

134
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:16,800
John 3, 36 says, He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.

135
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,640
What is God's wrath?

136
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,680
It is all that hell has to offer.

137
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
That's the wrath of God.

138
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:36,240
Because when people refuse and turn him down and die in their sins, a holy God must punish sin and pour out his wrath upon it forever.

139
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Where do you stand this morning in the light of eternity in a personal Lord Jesus Christ, a Savior?

140
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:56,240
Notice now the jailer was not only convicted of his need of a Savior, that was only the first step, he was also gloriously converted.

141
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:09,040
We visualize in our minds this rough, tough, muscular Philippian jailer in his fancy uniform and his sword girded by his side and suddenly and wonderfully take on a different appearance.

142
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:29,200
No longer do we see him a stern, determined look on his face with a rough voice with authoritative voice of command, but we see a man on his knees trembling in fear with tears of repentance running down his face and he in great awareness of his need of Jesus Christ.

143
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,800
Oh God, God can bring the most haughty person in the world to his knees in repentance.

144
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,200
If we hear, if he can get our attention.

145
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,320
We see the jailer's conversion.

146
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,040
What exactly do we mean by conversion?

147
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
We only have to look back at this Philippian jailer for the answer to this question.

148
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He was completely transformed simply by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.

149
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,760
He had been lost.

150
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,200
He was fearful.

151
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,760
He was at the point of committing suicide.

152
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:12,400
And then suddenly he was saved, rejoicing in the Lord, praising God for his goodness and confessing the Lord by baptism.

153
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
Let us observe briefly three things about this man's conversion.

154
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,080
Number one, his conversion was a radical experience.

155
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,120
Listen, my friends, every real conversion results in a complete change of life.

156
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:39,040
A person becomes a new person with new desires and new longings and new interests and new character and new hope and new outlook.

157
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:49,440
Some years ago in a church I attended, I knew a man and his face bore the marks and the bruises of the wages of sin.

158
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,320
He'd been the town's biggest alcoholic, the greatest bum on the streets, and the most notorious character around.

159
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,680
He had been the kind that most people would have passed by without notice or concern except to criticize and to condemn.

160
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
But this was not the man that I knew.

161
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,640
The man I knew was a new man, for he had been changed.

162
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
He had met the Master who had made the difference.

163
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,680
The Bible says, therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.

164
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,320
All things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

165
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:41,600
In verse 33 of Acts 16, we are told that this jailer became so altered, so changed, and so at one with Paul and Solas that he took them and he washed their stripes.

166
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,560
This surely was an evidence of a radical work of grace, wasn't it?

167
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,680
Notice, secondly, the jailer's conversion was a sudden experience.

168
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:04,720
Here we see from years of groping and darkness and shadows of night, suddenly in repentance and by faith and trust in Jesus Christ, he is walking in the light in newness of life.

169
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:23,440
My friend, whoever you may be right now, as we're contemplating about this jailer and his sudden conversion and his experience, if you've not been converted, then you may be converted this very moment.

170
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,600
If you will simply put your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior.

171
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:40,000
The way to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately you do that, you will be saved.

172
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,000
This is what we're told in verse 31 of our text in Acts chapter 16.

173
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,840
And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thy house.

174
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,840
The way to be saved is simply, straightforward.

175
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,640
Romans 10, 13 says, For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

176
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:13,280
The publican, remember a wretched sinner that he was, he would not so much as look up into heaven, but smote himself upon the breast and said, God, be merciful to me, sinner.

177
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,920
And God saved him, and he went down to his house justified.

178
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
My friend, if you're here today unsaved, you're lost.

179
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,760
And you're on your way to hell.

180
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,640
And like the publican, you're a wretched sinner.

181
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,040
But if you will call on Jesus right now and trust him, you will go down to your house justified too.

182
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you know Christ this morning is your Savior?

183
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,720
Are you satisfied in your life and in your heart?

184
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm on my way to heaven.

185
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,720
Thirdly, the jailer's conversion was a scriptural conversion.

186
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,600
You know, there's only one way to be converted, and that's the Bible way.

187
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,600
What is the Bible way?

188
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:02,800
It is all summed up in verse 31, and this verse in the New English Bible reads like this.

189
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,880
Put your trust in the Lord Jesus, and you'll be saved.

190
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Now, why do we need to put our trust in Jesus?

191
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,880
Because he's the only Savior.

192
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,080
There is no other way.

193
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:26,240
In Isaiah chapter 45 and verse 22, God says, Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else.

194
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:26,880
In St.

195
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,560
John 14, 6, Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh to the Father but by me.

196
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:43,440
In Acts chapter 12, 4 in verse 12 says, Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

197
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
Jesus is the only way.

198
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,720
People say, oh, there's different ways we get to heaven.

199
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,960
People say that the Muslims, they have their own way to heaven.

200
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
They worship God.

201
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
But they don't come through Jesus Christ.

202
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,840
And the Bible says there is no other way.

203
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,360
Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.

204
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,840
The jailer was brought under deep conviction, and this led him to seek the Lord and to ask the question, what must I do to be saved?

205
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,280
And then to put his whole trust in Christ as his Savior.

206
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,800
He was now converted.

207
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,080
But was that all?

208
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
No, that wasn't all.

209
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
There was also the jailer's glorious confession.

210
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,520
And looking at verse 32 of Acts 16, we read there.

211
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,320
And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord and all that were in his house.

212
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Oh, we see here Paul and Silas were engaged in teaching evangelism.

213
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,680
You see, it wasn't just the jailer, but they taught his whole house.

214
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,040
And they taught him about Jesus Christ, taught him how they too could be born again, and his whole house came to know Christ.

215
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,000
You know, teaching of evangelism in our church today is important.

216
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,240
Not only out here outside, but teaching in the church.

217
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,680
Evangelism.

218
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
This is urgently needed today.

219
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,760
You see, it's not enough to tell people that they need to come to Jesus and believe on him.

220
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Simply and solid instruction must be given.

221
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
And this is what we're doing today.

222
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:36,960
Evidently, and this evidently happened in the case of this jailer, and after he had received instructions from God's servants, he was led at once, even at midnight, to confess his Lord and all his family with him.

223
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,640
Now there are three ways in which he confessed that he was now a Christian.

224
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,280
First of all, he confessed by word of mouth.

225
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,160
Look at verses 33 and 34 of our Scripture.

226
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,560
Surely they imply this also.

227
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:59,520
And he took them the self-seeming hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized, he and all his immediately.

228
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,760
And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his heart.

229
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:16,800
These very actions of kindness and expressions of love now shown to Paul and Silas by the jailer are evidence of a changed spirit.

230
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,560
And surely there were words of gratitude and thankfulness.

231
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:33,520
Not merely to Paul and Silas, but words of thanksgiving and praise to God for having had mercy and grace upon him, unworthy as he was, and saving him from his sad lost condition.

232
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:42,000
You know, God's word says, Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven.

233
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,000
But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.

234
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:57,360
From Romans 10, 9, and 10, we are told, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

235
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,280
For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.

236
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,720
Secondly, the jailer confessed that he was now a Christian by obedience in baptism.

237
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,480
He desired to follow the Lord Jesus in complete obedience.

238
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,320
Oh, that we have people today within our church who are willing to follow God in full obedience.

239
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,720
They're people that have come to know the Lord as their personal Savior, but they haven't followed the Lord in believers' baptism.

240
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,840
He desired to follow the Lord Jesus in complete obedience.

241
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,800
He wanted to be baptized and experienced the blessed joy of believers' baptism.

242
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,320
There was no waiting.

243
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,520
There was no excuses for not being baptized.

244
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:58,480
Evidently, Paul had spoken to this jailer about the express command of our Lord Jesus Christ when he said, Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

245
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,600
Paul had also apparently told him that this was the Lord's way for every believer.

246
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,280
My friend, are you here today a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ?

247
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,920
And you have no doubt whatsoever that you're a child of God.

248
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:26,000
You have no doubt that you're on your way to heaven, and yet at the same time, you know there is something lacking in your life because you haven't followed the Lord in full obedience and believers' baptism.

249
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:36,240
Perhaps you've never come forward and made a public confession of your faith in Jesus Christ and said you want to follow the Lord in full obedience and baptism.

250
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:53,280
Today will be an opportunity for you not only to confess Christ publicly, but to confess him with a desire in your heart in believer's baptism and then into the full fellowship of Emmanuel Baptist Church.

251
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,680
You know, one day Moses stood and he said to the Israelites, who is on the Lord's side?

252
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Let him stand by me.

253
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:16,640
And those who stood for God and those who loved God and those who confessed him came and stood by Moses because they said, I want to follow God with all my heart.

254
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
I want to be in full obedience to him.

255
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,120
I want to give myself wholly and completely to Jesus Christ.

256
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,200
What will be your response today?

257
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,040
This is your opportunity.

258
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,280
Thirdly, the jailer confessed he was now a Christian by enjoying fellowship with other Christians.

259
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:46,880
In verse 34, we read, And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.

260
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
Oh, you know what he did?

261
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,720
He gathered his loved ones together so that they also might share in the blessing that he had received.

262
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:10,160
Listen, my friends, a real Christian confesses Christ by joining with others in fellowship, in worship, and in service.

263
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:29,360
You know, that's why it's so hard for me and for others to fathom that people say, yes, I'm a child of God, and yet they day after day, Sunday after Sunday, month after month, never darken his house.

264
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,400
Never come to begin fellowship and they grow in the Lord Jesus Christ.

265
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,320
What is wrong is because people are out of fellowship with God.

266
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,760
They're not walking in obedience to his voice.

267
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:58,880
Any real Christian is one who is dedicated and faithful and desirous of joining with other Christians in fellowship, in worship, and in service.

268
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,760
Is your allegiances this morning not where it should be, Christian friend?

269
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Make it right today with him, with the Lord Jesus.

270
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,520
In closing, I ask, how do you fit into this picture?

271
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,560
Have you been deeply convicted and convinced of your need of a Savior?

272
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,000
That Christ is a Savior you need?

273
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,520
You know He is the only Savior.

274
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,120
There is none else.

275
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
There is no other way.

276
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,160
And men must come by faith and trust in Him.

277
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
Today, my friend, have you been converted?

278
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
Have you trusted Him as your Savior?

279
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,360
Have you definitely put your trust in Christ as your personal Savior?

280
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:58,000
Have you confessed Him by word of mouth, by baptism, in obedience, and by uniting in fellowship with other Christians?

281
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,160
O happy day that fixed my choice, on thee my Savior and my God.

282
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,880
Well, may this glowing heart rejoice and tell its raptures all abroad.

283
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,480
Tis done, the great transaction's done.

284
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,480
I am my Lord's, and He is mine.

285
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:28,320
He drew me, and I followed on, charmed to confess the voice divine.

286
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,320
Oh, my friend, today, are you confessing Christ to the world?

287
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,440
Are you standing up for Jesus?

288
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,360
Are you saying, Lord, I'm willing to confess you before me?

289
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,360
I will not deny you by your grace because I don't want to be denied before my Heavenly Father.

290
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,240
What about eternity?

291
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,280
Are you ready?

292
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,800
Are you prepared?

293
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,880
Have you followed the Lord in obedience to Him and baptism?

294
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Have you joined in the fellowship of fellow believers to serve God in your capacity?

295
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,960
If not today, the invitation is this to come to Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.

296
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,760
Come follow Him in obedience to baptism.

297
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:32,160
Come put yourself in this church to follow Him as a servant of His people.

298
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,600
Shall we pray?

299
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,320
God in heaven, we thank you this day because you love us.

300
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,000
We thank you, Lord, that you're all we need.

301
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,760
And Lord, anything else that we seek out there, O Father, is to no avail.

302
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,520
Because it can't help us.

303
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,800
But Jesus Christ coming into the heart can make the change.

304
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,040
He can make the difference.

305
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,240
And oh God, we thank you for that.

306
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:14,000
And today, oh God, if there's a life or heart who is here that without you, they've never said yes to Jesus Christ.

307
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,080
They've never asked him to come in their life and be their Savior.

308
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,680
Oh God, speak to that heart right now.

309
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:34,400
Father, if there's a person out there this morning who's not followed you in baptism, Lord, how can they be happy because they haven't followed God in full obedience to your voice?

310
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,320
Oh God, if there's a people out there this morning who needs to come and be a part of this church, oh Lord, lay upon their hearts to do so.

311
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:59,600
Oh God, if they love you and want to serve you, oh God, Lord, we need them so much here that come with us that we might serve you together to the glory of God.

312
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,880
Be with us.

313
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,920
Touch the heart who needs you most right now.

314
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
In your precious name we pray.

315
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,840
Amen.

316
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,040
Our hymn of invitation this morning is number 187.

317
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,080
187.

318
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
Shall we stand together as we sing?

319
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,160
And as God speaks to your heart this morning, would you come?

320
00:33:29,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Just a little Jesus Christ.

321
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,200
What have you come to this morning?

322
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
Does anyone else today need to come?

323
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
You need to give your heart to Jesus.

324
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
You need to trust Him.

325
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,440
Oh, how wonderful it is to know you're on your way to heaven.

326
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,040
Do you know that this morning?

327
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,520
Thank you, God bless you.

328
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's just thank God this morning that today He has come.

329
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,360
I'm going to have the privilege now to share the Word of God.

330
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
Trust Jesus as your Savior.

331
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,120
Let us just bow our heads as we are dismissed.

332
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,560
Lord God, we just pray, O Father, today, that you dismiss us in your love.

333
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
Thank you, dear God, for this one who's come.

334
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:38,320
Oh, Lord Jesus, what a joy it would be to just put her to Jesus that she might come to know you in peace of heart and mind.

335
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:45,040
God, this day, glorify yourself as we go forth for you.

336
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
Dismiss us in your love.

337
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,920
In Christ's name we pray.

338
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,800
Oh, by the way, I forgot to this insert.

339
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:30,720
If you're not prepared to give today, you can, there's a on the flap in the back, there's a thing you can fill out and mail to the local Lancaster Northwest camp, which is the group of Gideons in his area, and they'll send you a receipt and everything you need.

340
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,760
Thank you.

341
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,440
Thank you, Ray.

342
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,640
We appreciate the presentation here of the Bible ministry, and I know God does work through it.

343
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,800
When I was in Sanford, North Carolina, I was married at that time, but I believe that's the time this occurred.

344
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,920
I had a fellow come to the door, and he was in a drunken state.

345
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,800
But he knocked on the door, and he says, and I went out on the porch, and he says, I need God.

346
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:16,160
A lot of times people come to that point in their lives when they are in such a state, but they realize, boy, I can't find it in the bottle, but I need peace in my heart, and I need life.

347
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,000
And he said, I need God.

348
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,320
And he'd been up in his room, and he'd been reading a Gideon Bible in his motel room, wherever he was.

349
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,600
Well, my first impression was, well, boy, you're full of booze.

350
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,880
What can I do for you?

351
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,360
I wasn't at that time in the ministry.

352
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,200
But I said, could we go up to your room?

353
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,720
And he said, yes, we could.

354
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,200
And I went up there and shared the gospel and the Word of God with him.

355
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,160
And he trusted Christ as his Savior.

356
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,320
And I, of course, he didn't have any money.

357
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,960
He had drank a half a bottle of shaving lotion.

358
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,080
He had a peculiar smelling breath.

359
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,200
I don't know what kind it was.

360
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,520
Anyway, we talked and sexed the Lord.

361
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,200
And I didn't have much money, but you know, he didn't have any money.

362
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,640
I felt I should give him some money.

363
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,200
He says, I didn't come to ask for money.

364
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,360
He thought I needed God.

365
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,720
But I gave him $2 anyway.

366
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,120
And the next morning I received a letter from him of appreciation and thanks for sharing with him the Lord.

367
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,040
Did I do right in giving him money?

368
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,440
God knows I don't.

369
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:43,600
But if he trusted Jesus Christ, as he said he did, as his Savior, he found peace with God that he was looking for.

370
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
God does work.

371
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,640
Through the Word, it will not return into a void.

372
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,080
It is sharper than a two-edged sword.

373
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,760
We are thankful today, Ray, for sharing with us.

374
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,440
And as we come to the end of this service, we want to turn in our hymn notes to number 179.

375
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:16,800
Actually, before we have the hymn of invitation, I think we'll go ahead and receive the offering, and then we will have our song of invitation.

376
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,720
I believe we have to go to the next one.

377
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:14,960
Lord God, bless this offering to your glory and your honor and the proclamation of your truth as it is spread throughout the world through the ministry of the Gideons.

378
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,320
In Jesus' name we pray.

379
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,280
Amen.
