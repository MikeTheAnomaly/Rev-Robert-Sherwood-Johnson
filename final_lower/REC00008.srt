1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,840
How about an amen?

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,840
We rejoice in Christ our Savior.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,640
We thank you, Lord, for the privilege that is ours to meet again before you.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,000
Lord, to bring our petitions and our heartfelt thanks to you for all your blessings upon us, even this year.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:33,520
We thank you for this time of the year, oh God, that we remember afresh in thanksgiving to you for your blessings.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:43,440
Oh God, may we not only be thankful during this time of the year, but may every day be a time of thanks to our blessed Lord for his salvation free.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:55,280
Oh God, we pray now to just lift up every heart and life, and may every person who has come today rejoice in Christ, go away, having been refreshed in the fullness of your Spirit.

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,280
We pray in Jesus' name.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,240
Amen.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,480
Take the hymnals, please, and turn with me to hymn number 54 for the beauty of the earth.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,680
Number 54.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
Let's all stand against the pleasure.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,160
We'll sing the first, third, fourth, and six verses.

14
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
Please be seated.

15
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,760
The users have come forward now.

16
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
We'll take our morning offering.

17
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:16,480
Heavenly Father, we just give you thanks with a joyful heart and with a joyful mind and soul.

18
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,400
And we worship you with all that is in us.

19
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,800
Dear Lord, we just give a small token back to you.

20
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:36,560
And we recognize not the body you are, but it's us and our lives and all that we are and all that we ever will be.

21
00:04:37,040 --> 00:05:02,400
However, to do that, we are technically aware of the colours of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city.

22
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Please be seated.

23
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
Let us not just wait upon our Lord.

24
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,160
Our God and our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we come with grateful hearts today for you.

25
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,320
We come to you, O God, with the blessings that you have bestowed upon us.

26
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
And we give you thanks.

27
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:42,320
Lord, today we just pray that as we have assembled here together, thanking you, Lord, for our guests who are with us, we just pray, O Lord, that each one of us would just quiet our minds and quiet our hearts before you to hear you speak.

28
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
Lord, all the glory must go to the Lord Jesus.

29
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,360
Nothing of ourselves is worthy of glory.

30
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,520
And so, O God, we just commit to you this hour.

31
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:18,720
We ask, O Lord, that our hearts and our minds may be steadfast on you, that we might experience, O God, the fullness of your Spirit, the outpouring of your power, that in turn, O Father, we might go forth with a zeal for Jesus Christ.

32
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Zeal to tell the world who is lost in sin about the saving grace of our marvelous Lord.

33
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Oh, for the grace of God, we give you thanks.

34
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,440
Lord, today we lift up our voices in praise and thanksgiving and joy and happiness.

35
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,320
We thank you, Lord.

36
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Oh, God, God, in the lives of those who need your hand upon them so very much.

37
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Lord, you know, there's several in our midst, oh God, today that aren't able to be in our midst today, oh Lord, who need your hand upon them.

38
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:01,200
And we ask, dear Lord, to just reach out to them, fill them with your power, strengthen them by your might.

39
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:09,600
May they be well sown and beck again to worship with us in fellowship with one another.

40
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh God, guide us now.

41
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,320
Bless this day.

42
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Honor your word as it goes forth.

43
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
Bless the choir as they sing.

44
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,400
To you we give the glory and the praise in Jesus' name.

45
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,680
Amen.

46
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
Good to see each of you here this morning.

47
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,880
And we're happy to have each of our guests with us.

48
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,960
And the Lord bless you as you fellowship with us today.

49
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,240
If you'll take your Bibles, please, and turn with me to the book of Psalms.

50
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,040
Psalms 116.

51
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,160
This is a Psalm of Thanksgiving.

52
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,200
And that's the time about which we're about to celebrate.

53
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,920
To celebrate thanksgiving in a very special way to our Lord.

54
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:01,360
Thanksgiving for His blessings, for His joy, for the very life that we live, our benefits.

55
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:15,520
Psalm 116, reading the chapter, I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.

56
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,080
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

57
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,840
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of Sheol got hold upon me.

58
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,480
I found trouble and sorrow.

59
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
Then called I upon the name of the Lord.

60
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

61
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,560
Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yea, our God is merciful.

62
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
The Lord preserveth the simple.

63
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,280
I was brought low, and he helped me.

64
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,200
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.

65
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,480
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

66
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.

67
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,400
I believe, therefore, I believe, therefore have I spoken.

68
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
I was greatly afflicted.

69
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,000
I said in my haste, all men are liars.

70
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?

71
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,560
I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord.

72
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,680
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.

73
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,520
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.

74
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,720
O Lord, truly, I am thy servant.

75
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,720
I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid, thou hast loosed my bonds.

76
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,560
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord.

77
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:59,840
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, now in the presence of all his people, in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem, praise ye the Lord.

78
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,880
God and Heavenly Father, again we just pray.

79
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
Take this people's speaker, hide him behind the cross.

80
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,720
May Jesus Christ be seen today.

81
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
May his name be lifted up.

82
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,720
We pray.

83
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,680
Amen.

84
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,880
You know, every day of our lives should begin with the voice of thanksgiving.

85
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,160
Thanks be unto God for his marvelous gift of his son.

86
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
Praise ye the Lord.

87
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,160
One of the greatest Christian virtues is thanksgiving.

88
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,160
What is thanksgiving?

89
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:50,400
Thanksgiving is our grateful expression of thanks to God as we acknowledge him as all the source of all blessings.

90
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,040
Blessings bestowed in grace.

91
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:08,400
From the Epistle of James in chapter 1 in verse 17, we're told, every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation, neither shadow of turning.

92
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Today let us turn our hearts and turn our minds to meditate upon this 116th Psalm that praises God for the personal triumphs he has brought to pass.

93
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:29,200
We find that the author of this psalm had suffered a severe illness and had been in the very jaws of death.

94
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,920
We are told that he prayed with faith even against the flaws.

95
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:47,280
This psalm is a glorious shout of jubilation and thanksgiving because of deliverance from the illness that was already ushering him into the realms of the dead.

96
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,600
He declared that because of God's grace, he would keep on praising God.

97
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:01,360
The psalmist's great love for God and his gratitude to him prompted the psalmist to do something for the one he loved.

98
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:16,640
Oh, dear friend, does your love for God and thankfulness to him manifest itself in your life and the way you live and what you do for the one you love?

99
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,640
First notice how the psalmist testified to what the Lord had done for him.

100
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
Again we read verses 1 through 8.

101
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:33,760
I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications, because he hath inclined his ear unto me.

102
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,040
Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

103
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,680
The sorrows of death compassed me and pains of sheep got hold upon me.

104
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,680
I found trouble and sorrow.

105
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Then called I upon the name of the Lord.

106
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

107
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,920
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous, yea, our God is merciful.

108
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,920
The Lord preserveth the simple.

109
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,920
I was brought low when he helped me.

110
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,160
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me, with thee.

111
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,520
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

112
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,440
In verse 2 of Psalm 116, the psalmist testifies, he hath inclined unto me.

113
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:28,080
How precious to know that our God is always near with an open ear to those who call on him.

114
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,400
He hath inclined unto me, the psalmist said.

115
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,280
Therefore will I call unto him as long as I live.

116
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,560
How comforting it is to know that the Lord is interested in us individually.

117
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,560
How wonderful it is to know that he is an intensely personal God.

118
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,920
Psalm 23 is always a blessing to the hearts of God's people.

119
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:08,640
Just to read it and to meditate upon the personal pronouns, that they just lift up their hearts to God with inner thanksgiving and praise for the great love and compassion and care for us.

120
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,880
Listen to the words of this psalm and apply them personally to yourself.

121
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,560
Feel the comfort.

122
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,160
Feel the blessing, the joy that gives to you and me, the sheep of his pasture.

123
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
Hear the words.

124
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,200
The Lord is my shepherd.

125
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
I shall not want.

126
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,440
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

127
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,800
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

128
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
He restoreth my soul.

129
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,400
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

130
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,680
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

131
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,960
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

132
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,000
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

133
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,800
Thou anointest my head with oil, and my cup runneth over.

134
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,320
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.

135
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,720
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

136
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,040
Thank God that we're not alone.

137
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:37,840
Who can read Matthew 6 and verses 25 through 34 and not feel grateful for the security that we have in our Lord?

138
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,040
Listen to those words in Matthew 6.

139
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:50,880
Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body what ye shall put on.

140
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,960
Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?

141
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:03,120
Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.

142
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,520
Are ye not much better than they?

143
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,920
Which of you, by being anxious, can add one cubit unto his statue?

144
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,560
And why are ye anxious for raiment?

145
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,160
Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they spin.

146
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,040
And yet I say unto you that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.

147
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:36,240
Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith.

148
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:43,120
Therefore, be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or with what shall we be clothed?

149
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:51,600
For after all these things do the Gentiles seek, for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

150
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,880
Hear the comforting words and testimony of Jesus himself in John 14, verses 16 through 18.

151
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,400
And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever.

152
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:16,880
Even the spirited truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him, neither knoweth him.

153
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,760
But ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

154
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,520
I will not leave you comfortless.

155
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,440
I will come to you.

156
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,960
Truly, let us glorify the Lord.

157
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
Let us forever praise his name.

158
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,920
For he has inclined his ear unto us.

159
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,480
He has not forsaken us, nor left us alone.

160
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,920
The psalmist testified, Father, he hath heard my voice and my supplications.

161
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,640
Psalm 116, notice the first verse, I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.

162
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,200
Verse 3, the sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of Sheol got hold upon me.

163
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,280
I found trouble and sorrow.

164
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,840
Then called I upon the name of the Lord.

165
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,240
O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.

166
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I love the Lord, for truly he has heard.

167
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:31,280
We would notice that the Hebrew verb translated heard in verse 1 indicates more than simple to hear.

168
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,800
Simply to hear.

169
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,360
It indicates that God heard and he answered.

170
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,040
Glorious message and joy divine.

171
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Our God is always ready to provide.

172
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,640
The words of Jesus in Luke 11, 9 through 11 are reassuring.

173
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,240
And we read there, And I say unto you, ask, and it shall be given unto you.

174
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,000
Seek and ye shall find.

175
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
Knock and it shall be opened unto you.

176
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,880
For everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth.

177
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,080
And to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.

178
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,240
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will you give him a stone?

179
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,680
Or if he ask a fish, will he for the fish give him a serpent?

180
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:33,600
A loving earthly father will always give what is best and right for his son, even as our heavenly father always provides that which is right and needful for his children.

181
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:42,240
The psalmist cried, not only did he hear my voice, but he met my needs, and I love him for it.

182
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Praise his holy name.

183
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,080
But greater still, the psalmist testified, he offered his grace.

184
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,800
Look with me at verse 5 and 116.

185
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yea, our God is merciful.

186
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,480
Here the psalmist indicates that the Lord is gracious, righteous, and merciful.

187
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:14,480
How grateful we should be this Thanksgiving season for the grace of God.

188
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,120
Ephesians 2, 8 through 10 go like this.

189
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,320
Listen.

190
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,080
For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.

191
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,640
It is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

192
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:41,680
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

193
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,240
For by grace are ye saved through faith.

194
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,400
Think about it, dear people.

195
00:28:50,720 --> 00:29:14,160
In spite of man's undeserving, in spite of his unworthiness, in spite of his exceeding sinfulness and selfishness and self-righteousness and ungodliness, and although he is bent on fulfilling the lust of his ungodly heart, still God offers him his glorious grace.

196
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,840
Unmerited favor.

197
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,840
God's grace.

198
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:30,000
One by the name of Joe Ingrin tells about one Sunday morning how he benched at a little northern Oklahoma Sunday school, and the lesson was on grace.

199
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,560
And the teacher asked, what is grace?

200
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:41,360
And someone answered, said that grace is the unmerited favor of God bestowed upon us unworthy sinners.

201
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,280
Someone else made another thought, added another thought.

202
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,160
And then the teacher looked at a heavyset old man dressed in overalls.

203
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,680
And he said to him, Bill, what do you say grace is?

204
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:08,240
Bill thought for a moment, and he scratched his thinning gray hair, and finally he said, well, I ain't for sure, but I think it means that God provides all the stuff.

205
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,960
Yes, thank God, God provides all the stuff.

206
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,600
He provided on the cross of Calvary for us.

207
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:27,120
He died there through the merit of his suffering and his shed blood on that cross in order that we might receive and have heaven.

208
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,680
He took our place.

209
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,760
He was our propitiation for our sin.

210
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,480
He bore them in his body on that tree instead of us.

211
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:47,600
And by his marvelous grace, he forgives men and women and boys and girls of their sin as they put their faith and trust in him.

212
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
Have you done this, my friend?

213
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,760
Have you put your faith in Christ?

214
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
God provides all the stuff.

215
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,400
It's by his grace.

216
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,520
The psalmist goes on and he testifies, By that grace he delivered me.

217
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
By that grace, he delivered me.

218
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,320
Listen as I read to you verses 6 through 8 in Psalms 116.

219
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,200
The Lord preserveth the simple.

220
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,480
I was brought low, and he helped me.

221
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,320
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.

222
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,440
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

223
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,960
What a tremendous tribute to the grace and mercy of God.

224
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,360
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.

225
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,080
The psalmist had a terrible plight.

226
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,160
He was helpless, and God delivered him.

227
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,160
And in this light, how meaningful are the words in Isaiah 40, verses 28 to 31?

228
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,080
Hear them, please.

229
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,000
Hast thou not known?

230
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,720
Hast thou not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary.

231
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,600
There is no searching of his understanding.

232
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,760
He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.

233
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,160
Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.

234
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,760
But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.

235
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
They shall mount up with wings of eagles.

236
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,480
They shall run and not be weary.

237
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,760
And they shall walk and not faint.

238
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,000
Let us thank God, for he is awesome.

239
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Let us praise his name, for his deliverance is beyond wonderful.

240
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:58,800
The second point we want to make this day is that the psalmist rejoiced, and he responded to all of God's goodness.

241
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,480
For all that God had done for him, he responded in thankfulness and praise.

242
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,280
What was the psalmist, how did he respond?

243
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,400
What did he do?

244
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,000
And what did he say?

245
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,640
He said, I will take the cup of salvation.

246
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,520
Now let's go back and read.

247
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,440
Psalms 116, beginning with the 12th verse.

248
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,520
And he asked himself the question.

249
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,000
He says, what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?

250
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,960
And then he says, I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord.

251
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.

252
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,320
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.

253
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,960
O Lord, truly, I am thy servant.

254
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,960
I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid, thou hast loosed my bonds.

255
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,400
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.

256
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:05,360
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people, in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem, praise ye the Lord.

257
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,920
He said, first, I will take the cup of salvation, verse 13.

258
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:18,960
And this is the offer of God's grace, the unmerited favor that God bestows upon all those that believe in him.

259
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,640
And the psalmist said, I will take the cup of salvation freely given.

260
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,320
Oh, listen.

261
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:37,760
Sinner friend, if you're here, the cup of salvation is full, and it's running over to all those that respond and receive by faith.

262
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,920
Furthermore, let us see.

263
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,040
Salvation here includes more than being saved in an initial experience.

264
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,160
It includes salvation in the fullest extent with all its attendant blessings.

265
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,720
Today, Christian friends, think of all the blessings your salvation brings.

266
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,160
Think of all that your salvation entails.

267
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:07,680
Think how every day God delivers you from sin and sorrow and pain and troubles and sets you free.

268
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,960
Then just lift up your voice and thank him and praise his holy name.

269
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,440
Next, the psalmist said, I will call upon the name of the Lord.

270
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,040
Verse 13.

271
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,440
Here is a resolution to pray, to seek God's face, to commune with God.

272
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,360
The psalmist recognized prayer as a valuable ally.

273
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
You see, prayer seeks the help and strength of Almighty God.

274
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,840
Through prayer, the sinner invites and asks God to enter his heart and his life.

275
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,480
The prayer of the unsaved is to seek his forgiveness and salvation.

276
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,800
The publican smote himself upon his breast and said, God be merciful to me, a sinner.

277
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,440
The word of God says, whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

278
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,200
The psalmist said, I will call upon the name of the Lord, for he is my helper.

279
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
He is my supporter.

280
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
He is my victory.

281
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,080
Oh, my friend, today, have you called upon God in prayer?

282
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,040
Do you know that God is your ally?

283
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:28,080
That God is your helper, that God is your supporter, that God is your victory, that God is your Savior?

284
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,120
If so, just lift up your voice and praise God right now.

285
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,600
If you do not know God as your Savior, acknowledge Him right now as Lord.

286
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
You can do that right now.

287
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,320
Acknowledge Him as Lord.

288
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,320
Call upon His name and ask Him in faith to forgive your sin and to come into your heart and life.

289
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,160
And then just lift up your voices and praise His name in thanksgiving for what He has done.

290
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,800
In Psalm 116, verse 9, the psalmist says, I will walk before the Lord.

291
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,320
I will walk before the Lord.

292
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:26,640
He testifies that he always will be conscious that God is looking upon his life, knowing every thought and every word and every deed and every step.

293
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
My friends, today, are you sensitive?

294
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,400
Are you conscious today that God knows all about you?

295
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
God knows all about you.

296
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,440
There's not one thing God doesn't know about you and me.

297
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
Listen as I read Psalms 139, verses 1 through 5.

298
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,920
O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me.

299
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,600
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising.

300
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,240
Thou understandest my thoughts afar off.

301
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,040
Thou hast compassed my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways.

302
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,800
For there is not a word in my tongue.

303
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,600
But lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.

304
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,320
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.

305
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:30,640
In the light of these facts, the psalmist wanted his life to be pleasing to the Lord.

306
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,920
Is this your desire, my friends?

307
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:42,640
Can we join the psalmist in his words, I will walk before the Lord, pleasing in his sight.

308
00:38:44,720 --> 00:39:00,480
Not only had the psalmist contemplated upon the kindness and the love and the grace and the salvation of God for him, but he responded to God's goodness in saying, I will take the cup of salvation offered me.

309
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,680
I will call upon the name of the Lord in prayer and seek his face.

310
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,400
And in joyful gratitude, I will walk before the Lord, pleasing in his sight.

311
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,720
But even more, I will pay my vows unto the Lord.

312
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,800
Verses 14 and 18.

313
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:39,680
In his illness and his pain and his troubles and his sorrow, the psalmist had made a vow to God and he had promised to publicly praise God and to give him glory for his life.

314
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,880
We must remember, beloved, that a promise to God is sacred and it must be kept no matter what it is.

315
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,480
For God, you see, requires it.

316
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,440
Let us realize that we are not compelled to make vows.

317
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,480
But if we do, the Lord will hold us to our word.

318
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,680
Hear the words of Deuteronomy 23, 21.

319
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:19,040
When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it, for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and it would be sin in thee.

320
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,880
And these are my words, if you do not keep your promise.

321
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:42,480
In his thanksgiving and gratitude to God, the psalmist exclaims, Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.

322
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,640
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.

323
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,080
I will take the cup of salvation.

324
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,560
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord.

325
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,200
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.

326
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:16,880
And then as a psalmist comes to the climax of this psalm, can we hear him say in jubilant song, I will praise the Lord.

327
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,920
I will praise the Lord.

328
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,920
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me.

329
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,080
Bless his holy name.

330
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,800
Not only do we hear his voice of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, but he encouraged others to praise him.

331
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:48,240
Verse 19, In the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem, praise ye the Lord.

332
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:58,240
And I exhort today, together, let's praise ye the Lord, shall we?

333
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,960
Praise ye the Lord.

334
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,560
Amen.

335
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:15,360
You know, this Thanksgiving season, let us remember to praise the Lord for his goodness and for the wonderful works to the children of men.

336
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,640
Today, my friend, do you know this Savior?

337
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,040
Can you offer up to him, thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.

338
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,120
Thank you for the grace that was given to me.

339
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,040
Undeserving, unworthy as I am, thank you, Lord, for that grace that was poured out upon me.

340
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:44,000
If you can't, do you know there's no better time than right now, today, to place your faith in Jesus Christ.

341
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
Ask Him to be your Savior.

342
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,200
Ask Him to come into your heart and save you.

343
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,080
And then you can lift up your heart before Him.

344
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,680
Thank you, Jesus.

345
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,080
Thank you, Lord, for your wonderful grace.

346
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,400
Thank you, Lord, for your salvation.

347
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,560
I give you praise.

348
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,000
I honor you for all you are.

349
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,600
Do you know Him?

350
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,520
If you don't, would you receive Him?

351
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,440
Our invitational hymn this morning.

352
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:21,920
And then having received Him as your Savior, walk down that aisle to the public word to those about you to say, I have trusted Christ.

353
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,120
He is my Lord.

354
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,240
He is my Savior.

355
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,320
Our hymn of invitation is number 193.

356
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,920
193.

357
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,640
Shall we all stand together?

358
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,680
God our Heavenly Father.

359
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,560
It's like people who say, are you not heaven?

360
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
Or our life is faithful.

361
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,640
The world will tell you it's like you go away from your sister.

362
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,200
And I hope for the next video.

363
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,080
So I've got a lot of people.

364
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,760
Oh, look at that.
