1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,960
Most gracious and Heavenly Father, this morning as we come to thy throne again.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,520
We come with lightful hearts and joy as think of it.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,640
Lord God, we pray that as we come together today, that our minds and our hearts may be upon you.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,480
Totally.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,120
That Lord, that they have open hearts, that we may hear your voice.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,880
God, that we may respond.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,840
Oh, God, we pray that they are those Lord who are with us.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
We pray, O God, your Holy Spirit upon them, and wherever they lead it.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,440
That they may feel your presence with your joy.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,760
Let your love.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,080
And let their heart be filled.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,160
We pray, O God, that they, Lord, those Lord, that lift they need a hand upon them, your hand upon their hearts.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,360
We pray, O God, that we are paying it for traces of parables.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,080
We pray that your hand will be upon them, O God, and lift them up, O bed and her grandmother, O God, be with her.

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
Leave with her hand today.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
Administrative today.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,680
Lord, we do pray today for her.

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
Every heavenly family.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
Oh God, we do pray for her.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,440
The young lady is at home, dear Father, that you have your hand upon her in a special way.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:02:09,040
Oh God, that she may learn, O Father, that you have to truly trust in Christ, and have your hand upon her life, and her young lady, O God, that, O God, and the girl heard the passion of her love.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:55,120
I believe overcome that it is a proof that first of all, Lord of God, let's give praise to our Holy Ghost.

23
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,920
That He is a great position that He is our God and our Father and our Lord and our Savior.

24
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
That they're all very perfectly helpful.

25
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,960
And there is not like the Lord here.

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,200
Lord today, O God.

27
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,920
Let me have a step in heart for the Word of God today.

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,440
Let me learn Him.

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
Lord, Lord, let the Lord.

30
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Day by day.

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
Let me give you the praise of the Lord.

32
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,240
Glory be to Jesus.

33
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
Everyone, glory to Jesus.

34
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
Here we go.

35
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
A few things that are written down here and then the editor and your opinion.

36
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,920
We will reread this publicly at the end.

37
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,760
And then you'll notice there's a place for the women and the men.

38
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,560
But during this month of October, we have been emphasizing the importance of stewardship.

39
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,240
Individually, we have had the opportunity to seek the Lord as to our responsibilities as his steward.

40
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,520
And each of us may ask the question, how am I managing all that God has entrusted to me?

41
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
Am I a good caretaker in all the affairs that affect my life?

42
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Is the Lord, Jesus Christ, preeminent above everyone and everything in my life?

43
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:16,080
Truly, if you and I can say yes, Jesus Christ is first in my life, then you and I will be gloriously guided by the Holy Spirit and our stewardship first in the beginning of ourselves and then our gifts and our talents and our time and our adoring third glory of the Lord.
