1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,200
What a quite a bit we had last Sunday.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
That 54 last Sunday.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,800
And I just thought, well, this church will be filled this morning as we thank God for all this beautiful rain.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,960
We appreciate you being here.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,280
We got some children back there.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Thank God.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
It's important that we recognize not helping something.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
Now, we have seen God need us.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,160
Well, take your Bible, please, and turn to John, chapter 17.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,600
John 17.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm going to read just the first five verses.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
John 17.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,800
These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,800
Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,200
As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,120
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,600
I have glorified thee on the earth.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,120
I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,400
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
Lord in heaven, tonight, today, we do commit to you this service.

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,920
And we pray, O God, hide this speaker behind the cross.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,680
Say Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,480
These things.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,000
In his name we pray.

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,960
Amen.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:02,240
If we should try to cover all that is in this wonderful, precious chapter of John's gospel this morning, in the few minutes that's allotted to us, we would only have an outline.

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,560
We would only have a skeleton with no flesh.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:39,280
Therefore, from this chapter 17, I'm only going to consider the first five verses in which our great high priest lifts his heart of prayer and commits himself back to the Father to be restored to the place of glory above, where he is now presently seated at the right hand of the majesty on high, continuing in his love and mercy to bear up before the Father those who have trusted in him.

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:57,680
After you have gone home today from the worship hour, will you take your Bible and turn to the 17th chapter of John's Gospel and seek for what we are doing?

30
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,080
When he went back to the box.

31
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,920
And now here in the 17th chapter, he is presented as our great high priest with God, our great intercessor.

32
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:48,720
It is though we have been allowed to enter actually within the now rent veil and listen to the intercession of our great high priest as he speaks to God on our behalf.

33
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,400
This intercessory prayer which Jesus prayed can truly be called the Lord's Prayer.

34
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,080
You know, we usually use this term for the beautiful prayer that Jesus taught his disciples when they came to him and said, Lord, teach us to pray.

35
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:10,400
And he said, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, and right on through.

36
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,760
But this is not really the Lord's Prayer.

37
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,040
It is a prayer given by the Lord, but the Lord himself never prayed that prayer.

38
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,880
You see, the Lord Jesus could not say, forgive us our debts or forgive us our trespasses because he had no debts.

39
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,960
And of course, he had no trespasses.

40
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,320
But he prayed for others, but not with them.

41
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,400
When he was on the hillside, all night long in prayer while his disciples slept, have you ever wondered what he said then?

42
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Well, from this high priestly prayer, you can get an idea of the petition he brought to the Father.

43
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,280
Does the praying of our Lord teach us anything?

44
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
Does it really teach us anything of his humility?

45
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:04,160
Lest we forget, may we be reminded that our blessed Lord was as truly man as if he were never God.

46
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,920
And he was truly God as if he had never been man.

47
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,760
He was the only absolute sinless one.

48
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,280
He knew no sin, and yet he took the place of dependence as a humble petitioner in prayer.

49
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,280
Ah, do we who are sinners take the place of full dependence upon him in humility?

50
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:39,680
Or do we often depend upon ourselves and end up distressed and depressed and helpless?

51
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:49,680
As has been mentioned already in this 17th chapter, we have our Lord praying largely for his own.

52
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,520
But now in these first five verses, let us consider his prayer in regard to himself.

53
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Will you look again at verse 1 in our text, and shall we read again verse 1?

54
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,920
And it says, These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come.

55
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,640
Glorify thy Son, that thy son also may glorify thee.

56
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:29,440
Toward this hour of glorification, our Lord had been looking not only ever since the beginning of the world, but before the world began, when he said in eternity past, Lo, I come in the volume of the book.

57
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,680
It is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God, thy law is within my heart.

58
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,320
He was willing to come into this world, to go to the cross, to settle the sin question.

59
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,200
Now the cross is before him, only hours away.

60
00:09:48,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Soon he will be hanging on that tree in the sinner's rightful place, bearing the sinner's judgment, bearing our penalty, bearing our sin, and yet he looks on it in perfect confidence because he knows that he cannot be held by death.

61
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,120
He is looking on it onto the resurrection through which he would receive glorification and would glorify the Father.

62
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:32,080
From verse 1, we have here the glory of our Lord presented in the distinct ways, two distinct ways, his essential glory and his acquired glory.

63
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:40,080
In this first verse, when he says, Glorify thy Son, that thy son may also glorify thee, we have the acquired glory.

64
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,240
In verse 5, he says, O Father, glorify me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

65
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
Here he speaks of his essential glory.

66
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,560
You see, he was one with the Father from eternity.

67
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:12,160
Yet in infinite grace, he laid aside the outward signs of glory, and he came into this world as a stranger and a pilgrim in identifying himself with mankind, yet without sin.

68
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:23,040
Now he is going back from whence he came, and all that has been hidden will be fully manifest, his essential glory as one with the Father.

69
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,120
How does verse 1 speak of the glory our Lord acquired?

70
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
He does it by his coming into the world and doing his work down here.

71
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,960
First of all, only through the cross was he able to receive the glory of Saviorhood.

72
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,360
Otherwise, he could have never been a savior.

73
00:11:48,720 --> 00:12:05,040
In Hebrews, we read he was made perfect through suffering, not as the character, for he was always perfect in character, but without his sacrificial death, he could have never been the captain of our salvation.

74
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,680
The suffering Savior brought our salvation free.

75
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Secondly, we have his glory as head of the church.

76
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
He was always the head of creation.

77
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,760
In Colossians, we read that he brought everything into existence.

78
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:29,440
It is in the resurrection that he is the firstborn among the dead and that he becomes the head of the church.

79
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:39,520
Thirdly, there is his glory as the coming king who will reign over Israel and over all the people to the ends of the earth.

80
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,320
And of course, this was dependent on his obedience to the Father's will down here from the manger to the cross.

81
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,160
And in view of this, he is the proclaimed Jehovah's King over all the earth.

82
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,920
Isn't it a glorious thought to ponder this morning, beloved, that we shall share with him in all his acquired glory?

83
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
We should experience with him.

84
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,480
However, we will not share in his essential glory because we will never become a part of deity.

85
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:19,520
Even though the New Agers in their perverted folks believe they become God and are a part of deity.

86
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
You might ask, how do we share in his acquired glory?

87
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,920
We do so because we share the fruits of his saving work.

88
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,960
Because of his work in Calvary, we attain this glory and have been made members of the body, the church.

89
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,000
We have been made heirs and joine heirs with Jesus Christ.

90
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,320
Of which he is made.

91
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,480
We are members of the body of Christ, the pride of Christ.

92
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,440
And then, of course, his word tells us that he shall reign, we shall reign with him.

93
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,000
Thus we share in his acquired glory, but we worship and adore him in his essential glory.

94
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:23,440
Looking now at verse 2, we read, As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

95
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:35,920
This statement of our Lord is in accord with his declaration in the last chapter of Matthew, where he says, All authority is given unto me.

96
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,160
God has committed all authority unto the risen Christ.

97
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,960
And through his death and through his resurrection, he gives eternal life.

98
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:58,320
In this uttered statement of our Lord here is his own recognition of his deity, because it is only as the divine one that he gives eternal life.

99
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,080
Let us notice the last phrase of verse 2.

100
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,160
As many as thou hast given him.

101
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Seven times, a similar expression of this phrase is used in this chapter.

102
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240
What does it suggest?

103
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:22,320
It indicates that the Lord Jesus thinks of all his redeemed as the Father's love gift to the Son.

104
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
And think of it, beloved.

105
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:37,520
Every one of you, every one of you that has come to him by faith is one of those love gifts that God has given to his son because he bare our sins at Calvary.

106
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,320
Can you fathom such a glorious thing?

107
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:47,360
Jesus Christ paid the great price with his blood to wash and cleanse us filthy sinners.

108
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:57,040
And then God looks down on every individual that will believe on his son by faith and then gives that one to his son as a love gift.

109
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,680
My friend, have you ever received gifts for which you had to pay the price?

110
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,320
This is what Christ did.

111
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,760
Oh, how he cherishes those gifts, however.

112
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,960
Are you one of those gifts that he cherishes?

113
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,680
Oh, how he loves me.

114
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
Oh, how he loves you.

115
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,800
Oh, how he loves me and you.

116
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:33,040
In the mind of God, long before this world began, he gave every individual who would believe on his son to Christ for all eternity.

117
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,120
Our blessed Lord gives eternal life to as many as the Father has given him.

118
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,840
How many does he give to the Lord?

119
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
All who will come to him.

120
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,360
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me, Jesus said, I will in no wise cast out.

121
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,640
If you have not received Christ as your Savior, your Lord today, and you want to receive him, then come.

122
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
He will not cast you out.

123
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,800
Then when you have come to him, you can say, I am one of those whom the Father has given to the Son.

124
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,680
What a blessed consolation.

125
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,360
We belong to Jesus if you trust him.

126
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:29,040
From verse 3 we read, And this is eternal life, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.

127
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
This verse gives us the manifestation.

128
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,120
It shows us clearly eternal life.

129
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,000
That they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.

130
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,280
What does this mean?

131
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,720
It means we cannot know God the Father.

132
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,720
We cannot know God the Son apart from having eternal life.

133
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,280
Jesus says, Jesus gave men eternal life while he was here.

134
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,200
And he gives men eternal life still by enabling them to know God.

135
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,640
So whoever knows God through Christ is in possession of eternal life.

136
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
And if you don't know God, my friend, you cannot enter.

137
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
There is no other way under God's heaven.

138
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,120
Neither is there any name under heaven given among men whereby we might be saved.

139
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

140
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,600
And no man comes to the Father but by me.

141
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
It's not by good works.

142
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,680
It's not by all our good doings and our goodness and kindness.

143
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,040
And all these things are great and important, but my friend, they will send you to hell.

144
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,000
Get there by knowing the Father.

145
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,680
To know him is to know I can hear you.

146
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,720
In the fourth verse, our Savior presents two things that we must make note of.

147
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,640
Let us read his glorious words that he speaks to the Father, and he said, I have glorified thee on the earth.

148
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,560
I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

149
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,800
First of all, our Lord goes back over his journey here on this earth and he says, Father, I've glorified thee on the earth.

150
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,520
He had not one regret.

151
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:37,840
There are things in the world today that would doubtless, no doubt, that would, those who would deny the deity of our Lord, but all they need to do is to think back on Christ's record.

152
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,600
He lived down here on this earth, and he never had one regret.

153
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,320
He never said one word that he had to apologize for.

154
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,920
He never did one thing that he wished later he had not said or done.

155
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
He never made one mistake.

156
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:04,000
He never stumbled once on all the rocky path he tread from the manger of Bethlehem to the cross of Calvary.

157
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
How different from ourselves.

158
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,680
How could anyone challenge his deity?

159
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,960
How many can the world name who is free from all sin?

160
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
None, my friend, none.

161
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,680
Only he whom God sent from heaven knew no sin.

162
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,560
And Jesus knew he had not sinned.

163
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,840
And looking back over his life, he said, Father, I have glorified thee on earth.

164
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,640
In everything he said and did, he had the Father's glory.

165
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,520
We notice the second thing.

166
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
I have finished the work thou gavest me to do.

167
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,520
He said, Father, I've shown to the world the great loving heart.

168
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,800
Father, you are God.

169
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,760
I've glorified you on earth.

170
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,120
I've made manifest to the world my Father in heaven.

171
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,120
He said, I have finished the work that I gave you to do.

172
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,080
Here you see, he has left us an example that we should follow in his steps.

173
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:20,720
In John chapter 2 and verse 6, we're told, he that saith, he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk even as he walks.

174
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,040
Oh, you know, we can never walk perfectly as he walks.

175
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,280
We are full of failure.

176
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,240
But we can at least follow in his steps and seek to walk as he walks.

177
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:39,360
We read of the Apostle Paul who said, nearing the closing days of his ministry, he said, I have finished my course.

178
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,680
I have fought the good fight, and now I am ready to be offered.

179
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:56,720
Although Paul, who would be the first to admit it, failed many times, yet he followed in the Savior's steps and he glorified the Lord and he said he could gladly say, I have finished my course.

180
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,520
And we say that, my friends, when we come to light in it, and we stand before God, can we say, I have finished my course?

181
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,600
And said with joy unspeakable, I have finished my course.

182
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,160
We notice the order in which our Lord spoke these words.

183
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,920
First he said, I have glorified thee on earth.

184
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
I have finished the work thou gavest me to do.

185
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
First of all, he had before him the glory of God.

186
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,720
And then the work that was committed to him.

187
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,800
As we follow in his steps, there's something more important than working.

188
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,920
The glory of God comes before working.

189
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,760
You know, oftentimes when one is converted, we say, put him to work, give him something to do, but what happens?

190
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,320
Some people do things they are not prepared to do.

191
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,680
And work becomes a legality.

192
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,800
They are put to work before they know the blessedness and fullness of grace.

193
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,920
And they have no chance to see if God is glorified first of all in their life.

194
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
Or to see if he is foremost in their heart.

195
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,360
Or to see if his will is the first concern of their mind.

196
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Oh my, how we need to get our priorities right.

197
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,040
Do we know if God is being glorified in our lives?

198
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Is he the first in our hearts?

199
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,800
Is he first in our life?

200
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
Is he first in our giving?

201
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Is he first in our talents?

202
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,960
Do we realize that he is the owner of our lives and that all that we are belongs to him?

203
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
Is he first?

204
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,160
Does he have priority in our lives?

205
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,080
You know, it's more important that God be glorified than that I accomplish certain things in the line of service.

206
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,840
You know, some invalids often bring more glory to God than he who can move around so easily.

207
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,400
The story is told of a dear mother and her daughter who lived in a tenement house set back off in the street, from a back street.

208
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,160
And the daughter, a young woman of perhaps 32, cared for her, her mother, dear mother, who sat in a child's high chair.

209
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,440
And she'd been afflicted with entire paralysis.

210
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,120
And for many years before, and for 22 years, that had been her throne, this little high chair.

211
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:40,880
And she sat near the window with a little desk before her, and she wrote letters to people in affliction and trial all over the world.

212
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Someone who had come to visit with them, to these lowly ones, began to express his sympathy for this paralytic woman.

213
00:24:49,360 --> 00:25:01,360
But the dear, shriveled-up little woman looked up with a smile on her face and said, I believe God gets more glory out of my life here in this chair than he would if I could run around.

214
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm content to be here to glorify God.

215
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
And then she began to talk about service.

216
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:16,640
And the minister then found that she was doing a wonderful service sending out letters to other sick women.

217
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,040
In her condition and in her attitude of heart, she glorified God for her.

218
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,960
And then did the work he gave her to do.

219
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,080
You know, this is always the order.

220
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
But we have often reversed it and we put work first.

221
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:43,680
And as the Lord says, I have glorified thee first, then I have finished the work.

222
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,200
Let us follow in his steps.

223
00:25:48,400 --> 00:26:03,520
Although the actual work on the cross at the praying of this prayer was not yet accomplished, it was only hours away when Jesus would cry out, it is finished.

224
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,600
And the atonement for our sin was forever set.

225
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,840
In this last statement, however, our Lord prays to the Father as though the cross were already in the past.

226
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,600
And he says, I have finished the work thou gavest me to do.

227
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,560
You see, in the mind of our Lord, this evidently took in the entire work of making atonement.

228
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,040
So he goes on beyond the cross and up to glory.

229
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:51,040
And as he prays this prayer, we are listening to the high priest within the veil in the holiest of holies interceding in behalf of his own.

230
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,840
And after the completion of making atonement and the resurrection, he takes his place as our high priest in heaven.

231
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,920
So, you see, he anticipates the cross.

232
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,320
In these words, I have finished the work thou gavest me to do.

233
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,840
In other words, I have accomplished that which I came to earth for, for which I laid aside my robes of glory.

234
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Now I am going back to the sea.

235
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,960
So therefore, in verse 5, we hear him pray these words.

236
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:34,880
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

237
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,520
When he was here on this earth, he did not lay aside his deity.

238
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,360
He was still truly God, the eternal Son manifested in the flesh.

239
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:59,040
Now when the work is finished, he goes back to take the glory he had left, not to be reabsorbed into deity.

240
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,760
To go back into glory as one with the Father with sin.

241
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:20,640
When our Lord Jesus Christ came to this earth, he laid aside his royal robes of glory, being one with Father.

242
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
And he came as God, clad in robes of flesh.

243
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,720
So in his coming, he glorified God.

244
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:42,320
He finished the work, and then said, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world.

245
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,560
So he returned to the Father, from whence he had come.

246
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,520
And now what does he do?

247
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
What is our Savior doing?

248
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:08,800
Yes, he is there in the heavenly sanctuary, sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on High and our great high priest, Emperor, living, and mercy.

249
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,080
Hallelujah, Watson.

250
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,920
Oh my goodness, David.

251
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Do you realize the idea of all the country?

252
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,880
Have you really comprehended in your life what it is to do?

253
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,360
Ungodly and undone and unworthy as we are, Jesus painted off.

254
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,160
We did what we could not do at all, and worked for you.

255
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,480
Navy has got to be controlled.

256
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,640
And in spite of the fact that we're sin, God, we're in this old blessing.

257
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,840
We do sin day by day, and oh, how we do sin.

258
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,960
But God sees the whole people.

259
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,240
No hint.

260
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,120
Come on, you're not sure you're child of God.

261
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,360
They're all not ready to go.

262
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,280
And Jesus said, these things that are written under you that you may know.

263
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,440
People are doing this.

264
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,680
If you want to.

265
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,280
Welcome to the hour of the board.

266
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,400
Welcome now, Warfield.

267
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
Coming up here and saying to the preacher.

268
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,920
I want to go away.

269
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,920
I'm coming to the board.

270
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,640
I realize that I'm unworthy.

271
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,400
I realize that I'm helpless.

272
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,760
I realize you died for me and you paid my price.

273
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,560
I wanted to.

274
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
How many I see you see by the way?

275
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,240
They're along.

276
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,080
There you go.

277
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:52,720
All of them feeling trying to find something to pacify, something to give them peace and to give them hope and to straighten out the turmoil of the pro-world.

278
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,280
I have a car.

279
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,200
All have to be.

280
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,680
Guard a few people in this church.

281
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,880
People out there all guard with them.

282
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,320
Members of this church that never tried to come to the fight.

283
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,680
They were just coming to stay all guarded.

284
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,200
I just went right away in the church.

285
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,840
And I realized I stayed home.

286
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,280
Because he's ruling at the bottom.

287
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,880
He's ruling at night and I'm coming.

288
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,560
We'll go into pressure today, but I'm not sure they're going to be.

289
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,840
I know that they're on their way to heaven, but they speak to the door for the lake.

290
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,120
That's right.

291
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,840
Our total invitation this morning is number 409.

292
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,680
We walk the river.

293
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,480
And again on the road to perfection.

294
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:51,920
And when the Lord Jesus comes to receive his opponent to himself into that perfect white city, there we will be perfect just like he is.

295
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,840
For there will be no sin where Jesus is.

296
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,600
Oh, I'll long for the day when Jesus takes me home to be with him.

297
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I'll come for the day when Jesus comes to receive us.

298
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,200
Are we aware of how close it might be?

299
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,880
Are we prepared?

300
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm talking about Christians to Jesus.

301
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,120
Are we prepared for that great?

302
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
On Jesus Christ.

303
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
There's coming a day of public wake up.

304
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,880
It will be a solemn day.

305
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,240
Me will suddenly wake up and realize their own goodness.

306
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:59,840
Oh goodness double and what an awful, awful feeling they will have in that day.

307
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:39,600
A course that they cannot undo a course in which they have been trapped a which they cannot undo and their doom has come is coming for the lost hope for the person outside of Jesus Christ today is the day of salvation Today is that opportunity Today is that it's that what is the time for you How about you?

308
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,240
Are you good with Jesus Christ?

309
00:39:44,800 --> 00:40:17,760
Not only would there be a solemn day, it would be a sure day You see God's wrath is going to be poured out upon them And no matter how a person thinks they're doing alright and they're okay and they'll make it okay one day the wrath of God is going to fall One day God's wrath is going to be poured out because he's a just God because he's just he has to punish and sin will be punished.

310
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
My friend are you a sinner today?

311
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,360
Are you lost in the sin?

312
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,280
Or are you a sinner today that's been saved by the matchless precious love and grace of Jesus Christ?

313
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,120
What a difference.

314
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,400
What a difference.

315
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,400
Do you know I'm your Saviour?

316
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,240
From Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 27, we're told for it is appointed unto me and wants to die.

317
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,640
But after this, the judgment.

318
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480
If there's anyone in our midst this morning, that would be fair.

319
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,200
Go without coming to Jesus Christ.

320
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,920
I'm a sinner.

321
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
I've been up in the head.

322
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,400
I've been without you for all eternity.

323
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
That break would be fixed.

324
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,680
I couldn't get to you anymore.

325
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,360
I've never felt the convicted power of Jesus Christ in my heart.

326
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,440
Do you know what to think?

327
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,200
Are you ready to meet him?

328
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,560
Christian, are you ready in your heart?

329
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,960
Jesus calls you.

330
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,360
Are you ready spiritually?

331
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,280
Are you living for God?

332
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,560
Are you living committed to him and being the kind of shining light and testament like you ought to be?

333
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
Are you witnessing for Jesus?

334
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,640
Are you telling the good news about your life that others would see him?

335
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,200
Are you dedicated to him?

336
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,080
Oh, we need to be ready when Jesus comes.

337
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,720
If you need to come today and to ask Jesus Christ, to ask for his plan in your life, I want you to come.

338
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,200
If you don't know him as your personal Savior, you need to trust him.

339
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:03,840
And today, my friend, if you're here and you're a child of God, and you're not walking as you ought to walk, you need to come and say, Lord, I want to recommit my life to you.

340
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,680
I want to recommit my services, my talents, my all.

341
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
I want to be rededicated to you.

342
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,520
What's your choice today, my friend?

343
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,120
What is our place?

344
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
What is your place today?

345
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,520
What are you staying in the block of almighty God?

346
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,320
Shall we pray?

347
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,440
The sin of the senses revealed.

348
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,360
The sin of the sension revealed.

349
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,440
Perhaps it's related to the book of 2 Kings chapter 35.

350
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
2 Kings chapter 5.

351
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,280
And we want to read together.

352
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,960
Verses 8 through 27.

353
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,240
Oh, I've lost my walk.

354
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,520
I have no way of knowing.

355
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,520
I found a job.

356
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,440
You know, I can't believe it.

357
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,240
Somewhere I put it around the house on the other side.

358
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,840
What night is that?

359
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,200
Okay.

360
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,480
We're going to begin reading here with the 8th verse, 8 through 27.

361
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:25,600
And it was when Elisha, the man of God, had heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, and said to the king, saying, Why hast thou torn thy clothes?

362
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,640
Let him come down to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

363
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,160
So Naman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

364
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:44,400
And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and watch the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.

365
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:56,800
But Naman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place and cure the leprosy.

366
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:04,560
Are not Albana and Arthur rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel?

367
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,960
May I not wash him again and be clean?

368
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,840
So he turned and he went away in a rage.

369
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:19,680
And his servants came near and spoke unto him and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?

370
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,840
How much rather than, when he saith to thee, washed and be cleaned?

371
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:31,440
Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God.

372
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,640
And his flesh came again, like unto the flesh of a little five, and he was clean.

373
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:50,160
And he returned to man of God, he and his company, and came and stood before him, and he said, Behold, now I know that thou, that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel.

374
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,600
Now, therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servants.

375
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,960
But he said, As the Lord gives it, the poor whom I serve there, I will receive none.

376
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,600
And he urged him to take it, but he refused.

377
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,720
And David said, Thou dare not sin, I pray thee, begged to thy servants to renew the burden of the earth.

378
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:16,640
For thy servant shall henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods but unto the Lord.

379
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,600
In this thing the Lord pardoned thy servant.

380
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:36,320
And when my master goeth into the house of Ramon to worship there, and he layeth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Ramon, and when I bow down myself in the house of Ramon, the Lord pardoned my servant in this thing.

381
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,280
And he said unto him, Go in peace.

382
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,680
So he departed from him a little way.

383
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:53,280
But Gehazah, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman, disappearing in not receiving at his hand that which he brought.

384
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,920
But as the Lord gave it, I will run after him and take somewhat of him.

385
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:07,040
So Gehazah followed after Naaman, and when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him and said, Is all well?

386
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,120
And he said, All is well.

387
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,920
My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from Mount Ephraim, two young men of the sons of the prophets.

388
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,880
Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver and two changes of garment.

389
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
And Namas said, Be content.

390
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,480
Take two.

391
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:36,880
And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags, but two changes of garment and laid them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.

392
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:44,160
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand and bestowed them into the house.

393
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,280
And he let the men go, and they departed.

394
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,920
But he, Genhezah, went in and stood before his master.

395
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,240
And Elisha said unto him, From where comest thou, Genezah?

396
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,680
And he said, Thy servant went not thee over there.

397
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:07,360
And he said unto him, Went not mine heart beat when the man turned from the chariot to meet him.

398
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:16,320
In this time he received money and received garments and olive lines and vineyards and sheep and oxen and infernal things and servants.

399
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:27,760
The leprechaun, therefore, of David shall cling unto thee, and unto thy feast forever, and he went out from his presence a leper and white himself.

400
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,960
Let us pray.

401
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,560
God in heaven, we just commit to me this day again.

402
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,480
We thank you, Lord, for your precious word.

403
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,720
We thank you for insight and wisdom.

404
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,640
We pray, O God, that we have read these words today, Lord.

405
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,560
May they sing it from our hearts.

406
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,040
And, Lord, may we dream the meaning from them that we have hundreds of people seeking the Holy Cross.

407
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,600
May Jesus Christ be praised.

408
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,320
Amen.

409
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,160
Yes, yes.

410
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,640
A poet by the name of Saber wrote these words.

411
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,120
My very thoughts are selfish, always building mean castles in the air.

412
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,720
I use my love of others for a gilding to make myself look fair.

413
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:18,720
Alas, no speed in light can snatch us wholly out of self-hateful sight.

414
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:30,320
Certainly from this scripture here in 2 Kings chapter 5, and noting especially verses 20 through 27, we have a picture of one who built his castle in the air.

415
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,280
He was building on the foundation, you see, of self-interest and greed.

416
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:48,240
And there are those today who still tried to build a God-pleasing life, a God-pleasing character on such a foundation, but their efforts are futile.

417
00:55:49,120 --> 00:56:01,520
Those castles built on the foundation of self-interest only look substantial in the eyes of the foolish builders, but they have actually no existence in the sight of God.

418
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:10,320
The true, the faithful builder builds on strength of God's foundation of truth and love and humility.

419
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,640
They do not build for self-interest, but that God may be lifted up and honored.

420
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:23,360
One must be careful and take heed where he builds, as well as what he builds.

421
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:38,080
The man Gehazah attempted his castle building in the air on the foundation of self-interest, self-dream, pristine, fame, fortune.

422
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,560
But he was doomed to a fearful disappointment.

423
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,680
Let us mark first of all the special privilege this man possessed.

424
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:57,040
From 2 Kings chapter 5 and verse 20, we learn that Gehazah was the servant of Elisha, the prophet.

425
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:06,160
Now, if he was a servant, then you might ask, what special privilege was there in this for him?

426
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:21,840
You know, perhaps our natural tendency is to think of, when we hear the word servant, of one that holds a very lowly position, this is because of the connotation that's been placed upon the word.

427
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:30,880
One might think of servants only as those who do the back-breaking job of working without much recognition.

428
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,760
We might think of servants simply as those who are aided to the rich and to the distinguished.

429
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,920
But let us realize that the word servant doesn't necessarily mean a place of lowly degree.

430
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,560
There are different kinds of servants.

431
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,640
There are the servants of the land who till the soil and grows the food for the rich and the poor alike.

432
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,360
There are the servants of war who carry honors.

433
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,800
There are servants of our country still whom we can uphold and honor.

434
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,600
Then there are servants of the Lord Jesus Christ.

435
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:10,160
And what greater honorable position could one have than just to be numbered among his servants?

436
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,840
Jehaza was the servant of Elisha.

437
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,440
Surely this was a privilege in itself.

438
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,480
Why?

439
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,960
Just to be associated to such a man of God.

440
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:39,760
Gehazah was the man by the side of Elisha to aid in the great and wonderful task of a prophet like Elisha himself, who was the attendant and disciple of Elijah and who received the mantle that fell from his shoulders.

441
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:45,360
Even so Gehazah was one in a position for spiritual enrichment.

442
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:54,720
Did you know that it is interesting to realize that the name Gehazah means a valley of vision, a valley of vision.

443
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:10,560
His name so very fitly represents his honorable position because many a vision of the power and the goodness of God did he get through the acts and the words of Elisha, his divinely appointed master.

444
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:26,640
But alas, but alas, although Gehazel lived and moved in a spiritual environment, a spiritual atmosphere, yet it seemed to me with all the pride and self-importance of an unconverted officer in the church.

445
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:35,920
Someone has said that spiritual influences and opportunities has about as little effect on some souls as the sunshine has on the toast.

446
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,280
And how very true that is.

447
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:47,040
There are those who can sit for years under the gospel ministry and yet be nothing the better of it in the end.

448
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:55,280
Jehaza, a man with such a special privilege, with such an opportunity, gained nothing at all.

449
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,280
But we find he was a man with a selfishness.

450
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:12,560
Let us notice the words of verse 20 in our text, especially the last part of the verse of 2 Kings chapter 5, verse 20.

451
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:23,600
But Gehazah, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman the Syrian in not receiving at his hand that which he brought.

452
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,280
But as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and I will take somewhat of him.

453
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,480
No doubt the temptation was exceptionally great to a covetous man.

454
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:47,040
And as we take a general look at Jehazah, simply from the reading of this verse 20, we immediately see that he is a greedy, selfish, covetous person.

455
01:00:47,680 --> 01:01:01,840
Here we see, here he sees an unprecedented opportunity, he thought, of making himself rich without robbing his master just by inventing a seemingly honest story to tell Naaman.

456
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,840
Jehazah said, I will run after Naaman, the Syrian, and take somewhat of him.

457
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:19,200
But you see, this I will, this I will of his was an act of rebellion against the spirit and the honor of his master Elisha and of his God.

458
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:31,280
For a few moments, as Jehazah thought on this strategy of this scheme, certainly there was that battle of good and evil fought within his soul.

459
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:40,880
Surely he knew that his master Elisha had turned down the gifts of Maaman that God might be glorified, that God might be honored.

460
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:51,680
But nevertheless, Jehazah's selfish love and covetous desire for material, temporal things caused him to surrender his will to do this evil thing.

461
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:05,120
And in so doing, in making such a decision, he revealed a sinful distrust in God and a desire to take the province of God in his own hands to do his own thing.

462
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,080
The Bible tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil.

463
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,640
No, it didn't say that money is the root of all evil.

464
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,200
But the love of money is the root of all evil.

465
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,040
Gehazah here completely reveals his first love.

466
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,480
It was for himself and his own self-interest.

467
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,480
It was for his own selfish pleas, for fame, and recognition, and power.

468
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,840
Isn't that so true in our world today?

469
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,920
People want power.

470
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:34,960
They want gain.

471
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,840
They want fame.

472
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,360
But they heat to themselves destruction.

473
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,760
In the third place, let us mark the deceitful work of this man.

474
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,800
Notice with me, verse 21 and 22.

475
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:57,200
And we read here, So Gehazah followed after Naaman, and when Naaman saw him running after him, he alighted from the carriage to meet him and said, Is it all well?

476
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,800
And he said, All is well.

477
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:06,720
My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there come to me from Mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets.

478
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,600
Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver and two changes of gold.

479
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:22,640
As soon as his mind was made up to do this main cowardly deed, he goes into it with all earnestness.

480
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,040
He has it all planned out.

481
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:37,680
So he runs after David and he begins this lying tale that his master had sent him to plead for help for two young men of the sons of the prophet that had come to him in need.

482
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:47,280
We notice that after his heart was sowed on this evil task, the first utterance he made was a lie against his master.

483
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:57,760
This evil story of Gehazah was not only proving him a liar, but it was also bringing reproach and grief upon his master.

484
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:08,320
Dear friend, if you are a believer in Jesus Christ, no servant of Christ can act falsely without bringing grief to his master's heart.

485
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:15,280
Oh, how it must have grieved the Savior's heart the night that Peter denied him there by the enemy's fire.

486
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,440
It was the love of money that stowed away the heart of Gehazah.

487
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:29,840
It has been said, as soon as the love of money strikes its roots into the heart, covetousness and falsehood must appear in the light as seen by God.

488
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,520
Beloved heart, Satan is no different today than he was in the time of Gehazah.

489
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:50,560
It is still his desired hope to fill our hearts with covetousness, with self-gain and greed, and to trick us to some cowardly lying scheme, even unto some act of pride.

490
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,040
Let us be on our guard, folks.

491
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,400
Let us be on our guard.

492
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,840
The Epistle James tells us, resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

493
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,360
The fourth thing we should notice this morning is the singing success of Gehazah.

494
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:12,880
We're aware of the fact and of the greed of Gehaza and his plan was to get for himself the silver and the garment.

495
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:22,800
But even he himself was no doubt surprised that the silver and the garment succeeded beyond his expectation.

496
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:31,120
Oh, isn't it that's normal and natural that the old devil is one who changes himself in the leaves of life?

497
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,360
And then if the devil had you already, he just makes things look better.

498
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,560
And boy, you just like, look how you are professing.

499
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,760
Look how you're doing, how great it is.

500
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,920
See, instead of him gathering one talent of silver, verse 23 tells us that he got two.

501
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,360
And moreover, Naaman sent two of his servants to carry the goods back to Gehabah's house.

502
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,880
How very fortunate this same thing for Gehavah.

503
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,280
But how truly fortunate was it?

504
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:12,080
What were his thoughts as he walked behind those servants of Naaman who were carrying the bags and garments all for his own use?

505
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,360
He might have been thinking, does it mean it pay to be a hypocrite?

506
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:25,600
Will these bags of silver or garments of beauty sufficiently compensate for a vile conscience?

507
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, whatever the thoughts may have been of Gehazer, we don't really know, but he must have been uneasy, far from contentment, far from peace.

508
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:50,480
During the rich man of Luke chapter 16 knew what it was to be clothed in purple and robes and fare sumptuously every day while Lazarus sat in his gate full of swords.

509
01:06:51,120 --> 01:07:02,480
But as we read farther on and we see this rich man's final end, we are aware that to be clothed in purple robes and to fare sumptuously every day is by no means the kingdom of God.

510
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,320
When we look at this man, we realize what the Bible says concerning the kingdom of God.

511
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:14,000
It says that it is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.

512
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,560
And we think of Lazarus.

513
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,040
Lazarus the beggar, he knew what it was to have deceived.

514
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,400
But the rich man didn't, though he had had much riches.

515
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:36,480
Neither could Jehazah, the selfish, covetous, envious worker of deceit, know joy and peace.

516
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,080
Even though he had experienced a seemingly greater success than he expected.

517
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:57,840
In the book of Psalms, chapter 73, Asiph said, I was envious when I saw the prosperity of the wicked until I went into the sanctuary of God, then understood I therein.

518
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,520
Oh, my friends, have you ever just thanked God for your father?

519
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,960
Have you ever thanked God that he set you where you are instead of rolling with all kinds of money?

520
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,280
This reminds me that whenever I am weak, as Paul said, then am I strong?

521
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:25,680
That God has kept me as I am, not one of wealth, but one that is concerned, realizing in my helplessness that God was a while money.

522
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,680
And it keeps me close to God because I fall on money.

523
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,560
That's what God wants.

524
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,000
That's why perhaps God teaches us without a lot of money, folks.

525
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,200
His people.

526
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,320
Because whenever we get a lot of money, we start to make a den in the world.

527
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,920
We become proud.

528
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,160
And we lose sight of God.

529
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,080
That's what Yehazim did.

530
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,680
He lost sight of God.

531
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:59,040
And he's like, in the case of this man Gehazman, the question is, will the eternal end justify the means?

532
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,800
Will success atone for sin?

533
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,880
The answer is a sad no.

534
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,640
Sin will be found out and sin will be punished.

535
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,280
This leads up to the fifth point of this message today.

536
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,920
Let's mark Gehazah's unexpected discovery.

537
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,080
Look at chapter 8, verse 25.

538
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,000
Verse 25 is what it says.

539
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:25,120
But he went in and stood before his master, and Elisha said unto him, From where comest thou, Gehaza?

540
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,240
And he said, thy servant went not here or there.

541
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,440
What do we see here, Gehazah, doing?

542
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,640
We see him as he tries to rule the world if he's not divided.

543
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:46,480
He went in and he stood before his master as he had done before, just as nothing had happened to mar their fellowship and his henry service.

544
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,480
And inside his heart, certainly, Gehaza knew that he was guilty.

545
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:59,600
He knew that he would not, that he would not admit it outwardly, you see, but his conscience, you see, was clear.

546
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,600
He simply wanted to maintain his good standing before his master.

547
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,080
So the first thing he did, he went in, took stand before his master.

548
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:26,640
And thinking that his guilt was not showing, let us ask ourselves, have we ever been guilty of this same thing in seeking to maintain our standing before our heavenly master while there is unconfessed sin in the heart?

549
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,040
And we know it, but some way or another we can justify it.

550
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,080
And Lord, I do thank you for you all.

551
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,480
And we justify ourselves.

552
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,320
There's a scripture for this.

553
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,480
The Bible says, be not deceived.

554
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,840
God is not false.

555
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,720
Be sure your sin will find you out, rendering you unfit for service.

556
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,320
Gehaza thought his sin was concealed.

557
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,480
But Elisha said unto him, From where comest thou?

558
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:58,000
And Gehazah said, thy servant went not here or there.

559
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,640
There was a bold lie here that Gehazah made, and Elisha knew it.

560
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:12,800
But Gehazah took that fatal refuge of all backsliders, and he made an attempt at self-justification.

561
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,200
He tried to hide his sin.

562
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:26,560
But the Bible tells us in Proverbs 28, 13, he that coveth his sin shall not prosper, but whosoever confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

563
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:40,080
The words of Elisha in verse 26, Let the shock Jehazah to his wits in all the selfish pride, must have withered away when he heard the prophet speak, went not my heart to thee.

564
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,800
And then he goes on to say, is it a time to receive money?

565
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:54,320
Is it a time to receive garments, olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men's servants and maidservants?

566
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:01,040
Elisha had spiritual perception, and he knew his servant was lying.

567
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,480
Gehazah's secret sin was naked and bare before the eyes of his master.

568
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,040
The real truth was revealed, and guilt was written all over Gehazah's face.

569
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,880
There was no way to cover it up.

570
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:21,120
Oh, dear Christian friends, does not the heart of our Lord, does not the heart of our master always go with us?

571
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,120
If we're a child of God, then what the Lord go with us?

572
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,160
Praise His sin.

573
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,560
Is this heart with us?

574
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:37,040
One day must we not stand before Him too to give an account of the deeds done in the body?

575
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,880
At that day, when we stand before Him, every secret sin will be revealed.

576
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:51,280
Today we may hide our sin from the eyes of men, but they will be naked before Him.

577
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,360
Shall our final appearing bring shame or reward?

578
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:05,680
Is there a time to be seeking for self-esteem, honor, and recognition when we ought to be seeking only the glory of God?

579
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,680
Remember, we are not our own.

580
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,520
We have been bought with a price, and our chief end is to glorify God forever.

581
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:23,520
We move now to the final point this morning, and that is the terrible punishment of Gehazah.

582
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,640
You see, sin must be punished.

583
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:36,880
In verse 27, Elisha said to Gehazah, The leprosy, therefore, of Naban shall cling unto thee and unto thy seed forever.

584
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:41,440
And he went out from his presence, a leper, as white as snow.

585
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,640
Oh, the last statement is an ugly one.

586
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,920
He went out from his presence, a leper, as white as snow.

587
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,120
Here, we have a picture of death itself.

588
01:13:53,680 --> 01:14:01,200
Leprosy eats away at the body of man, and infection sets in until finally physical death comes.

589
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:10,080
And like leprosy, sin eats away at the soul of man until his heart and his life is filled with corruption and wickedness.

590
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,120
The Bible tells us that sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

591
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:22,880
Jehazah went out from his master's presence, covered with this leather spot of sin.

592
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:31,920
And his covetousness led him to err from the faith and to pierce himself through with many thoughts.

593
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:50,000
You recall the words that Apostle Paul so clearly saved him in his first letter to Timothy chapter 6 and verse 10, for the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many thoughts.

594
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,160
This was so vividly carried out in the experience of Jehazer.

595
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:10,160
And as he went out from the presence of the master, not only was the terrible, miserable curse of leprosy placed upon him, but with it there was the sorrow of a personal humiliation and shame.

596
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:18,480
He was a leper, and to those who came near him, he must cover his mouth and cry, unclean, unclean.

597
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,320
For you see, he was a shameful, disgraced, and outcast in society.

598
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,440
But there was further punishment.

599
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,760
There was the sorrow of being alienated from his master.

600
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:39,600
He went out from his presence, separated, never to return.

601
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,240
Oh, such punishment indeed.

602
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,920
All this, my friend, is a punishment to those who die in their sins.

603
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:53,760
Eternal alienation from the presence of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ.

604
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,400
Oh, what an awful, what an awful punishment.

605
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:14,720
But when men refuse God and refuse to take him into their hearts and live for him, their destiny, according to the word of God, will be a time and a day that is forever in punishment, separated from God forever, alienated from him.

606
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:28,960
Finally, there was a third sorrow, and the sorrow of bringing his offspring into the same condemnation.

607
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:36,960
The words of Elisha were, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling unto thee and unto thy seed.

608
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,720
You see, no man liveth unto himself.

609
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:48,480
Let me tell you folks, that, believe me, our lives touch others.

610
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:58,240
And here in the case of Gehazah, the weakness and influence of this man would fulfill itself in your children.

611
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:07,200
How often, dear ones, have you experienced the weak and covetous spirit of Gehazah within your own heart?

612
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:19,680
Gehazah, having loved this present world and having denied God for dreams of gain, seemed to have become a castaway from disturbing God.

613
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,760
Castaway from disturbing God.

614
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,840
What about your life?

615
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,720
Are you building your future on the gains of this present world?

616
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,920
If so, you are building your castle at the end.

617
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:41,440
For the Bible says, what shall it profit a man, though he should king the whole world, and yet move his own soul?

618
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,800
And what is a man profited in the end if he lays up treasures on earth and is not rich toward God?

619
01:17:50,400 --> 01:18:00,400
And what shall it profit his children, though if they inherit his earthly riches, they also inherit his earthly spirit?

620
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,400
What about you?

621
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,600
Are you building your castle?

622
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,200
Is your interest only self-interest?

623
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:27,120
Is your desire in this life to just make a big splash and to be half fame and fortune, to have recognition of others, to cause others to look at you and say, wow, that's a person of power.

624
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,800
That's a person of dignity.

625
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,280
What is our purpose today?

626
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:44,960
Is it to be sold out to Jesus Christ or is it to fulfill selfish pleasures and self-mint?

627
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:56,960
The Bible says, he that coveth his sins shall not prosper, but whosoever confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

628
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,000
Isn't that a concluding, wonderful concluding thought?

629
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:09,760
That though we're wrapped up in this world, if we come to Jesus and say, God, forgive me.

630
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,920
Good God, mercy.

631
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,120
Forgive me for my sin.

632
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,960
Forgive me for my desire.

633
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,280
Forgive me for acting as I do.

634
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:25,760
Forgive me, Lord, for being selfish and self-sinnered and having tough history.

635
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:33,360
Forgive me, God, for not being what I ought to be before my family, before my friends, and before the world.

636
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,360
We come, we thank God forgiveness.

637
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,640
God be mercy.

638
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,000
Did not belong.

639
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,040
Heaven, mercy, said Christ.

640
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,040
What is my truth?

641
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,360
What is part of the doctor?

642
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,280
In fighting that you.

643
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,960
And Gehaza, had he come and said, Master, I failed you miserably.

644
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,080
I've sinned against you and against God.

645
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,320
Will you forgive me?

646
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,840
Elijah would have forgiven.

647
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,000
And God would have forgiven him.

648
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,320
But no, he went out from his presence forevermore.

649
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,200
Long to you.

650
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,440
Oh, God in heaven, we protect us for you.

651
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,440
All you are loving God.

652
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:43,280
Lord, that you pay the price, O Calvary, and in spite of our awful sins, in spite of our wickedness, and in spite of our continuing, Lord, so long in sin, yet, O God, your mercy is enduring forever.

653
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,640
Oh, Lord God, hear the voice.

654
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:58,800
If any man will hear my voice, then if any man will hear my voice and follow me, I'll speak him.

655
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,960
Because him is coming to me on the day when I can't tell.

656
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,200
Oh, God, today, it is a harder life than without you.

657
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:20,960
If it's a person who's walking afar off and sin, oh God, and himself and is in a backsliding condition, today, oh God, we pray that they just come back to you and say, God, forgive me.

658
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,920
Forgive me for being so selfish.

659
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:30,080
Lord, here, I give myself to you, and I ask, oh God, to fill me a new and affect with yourself.

660
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,640
Thank you to servant Jesus.

661
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,120
So be sick.

662
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,760
Oh God, thank you for the day.

663
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,280
Speak to heart to the glory to you.

664
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:37,200
Jesus Christ who need you most in Jesus' name we pray Amen
