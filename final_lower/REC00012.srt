1
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,680
Let's sing verses one and three, please.

2
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
Please be seated.

3
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
I have a question.

4
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
Have any of you sacrificed anything at all this week?

5
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,960
Have any of you gone without anything that you're doing?

6
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
Have any of you gone without anything you really?

7
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's just bow our heads in prayer.

8
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,200
Dear Lord God, what a challenge to our hearts.

9
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:28,320
We think of the many in those lands, O Father, who are hungry, just plain hungry, physically, who need the love and compassion of someone who cares.

10
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:42,320
We think of those, O God, who not only hungry physically, Lord, but within their hearts there is a longing and a desire, O Father, to know something in life that is greater.

11
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
A life of peace, a life of rest.

12
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh God, where are we?

13
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Where are we reaching out?

14
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Where is our hand of compassion?

15
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,480
Physical, Lord, where is our heart of compassion spiritually?

16
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh God, we think of the many who even in the land of China, the different ones that have suffered for the cause of Christ and suffered, oh God, not only just persecution, but have actually gone to the death.

17
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,800
And oh God, there's so many who need Jesus.

18
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,240
Oh God, our goal this year is $100 million for the Lottimon Christmas offering.

19
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,640
Oh Father, what a little, little, small amount is ours, our goal.

20
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,760
Oh God, give us compassion.

21
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:50,480
Give us desire to see Jesus Christ lifted up and that he might come into the hearts of many, many precious souls.

22
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,440
Oh Father, we thank you for this day.

23
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,800
We thank you that we can gather together in your house.

24
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,080
We can lift up our hearts of praise and thanksgiving to you for what you have done for us.

25
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:14,320
And oh God, we just pray that you will just cause us, dear Father, to let our hearts be softened and our souls be meek before our God.

26
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,680
That he might again fill us anew with new vision and new desires to serve him.

27
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
We pray, oh God, today for those who aren't able to be in our midst.

28
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,160
Lord, you know who they are.

29
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:38,640
Oh Father, we would pray, dear God, especially this morning for Carol Fleshman as she's in the hospital for catharization of the heart tomorrow.

30
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,520
And we just pray, oh God, your hand be upon her.

31
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,160
We ask, oh Father, that also for Mrs.

32
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:55,680
Brosi and bronchitis, and we just ask God to just touch her and make her well and completely refreshed in Christ.

33
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:09,120
We pray, oh God, for Charlie Heller this morning with his weakness and feeling and body, and we just ask, oh God, to touch him by your grace, by your mercy, by your wonderful power.

34
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:20,000
We pray, oh God, for Louise Foose this morning with her knee problem, Lord, and that this operation, how we pray, oh God, to give her relief of the pain.

35
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,520
She'd soon be able to be out with us again.

36
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:36,960
Lord, there's so many things, oh God, that we can give you thanks for, and in the midst of them, Lord, we give you thanks even for your hand that even right now is upon these people for whom we prayed.

37
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,720
And O God, we look to you now for your strength as we continue this morning in this service.

38
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh God, take the word of God and just apply it to our hearts.

39
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,560
May we be men and women and boys and girls of faith in Jesus Christ.

40
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
Guide us by your Spirit.

41
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
In your wonderful name, we ask it all.

42
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,840
Take your Bibles, please, and turn with me to the book of Joshua.

43
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,640
Joshua chapter 6.

44
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:16,400
We're going to read these verses that we have read previous and last Sunday's service because our message today, as it continues, is on triumph, faith, or triumphant faith in Jericho.

45
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,040
And so we begin with the sixth chapter and the 1 through 21.

46
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,880
Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel.

47
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,280
None went out and none came in.

48
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,120
And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given unto thine hand Jericho and its kings and its mighty men of valor.

49
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,320
And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once.

50
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,200
Thus shalt thou do six days, and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram's horns.

51
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,480
And the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

52
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:09,840
And it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horns, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up, every man straight before it.

53
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:19,520
And Joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of the Lord.

54
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,960
And he said unto the people, Pass on and compass the city, and let him who is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord.

55
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:39,120
And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of ram's horn passed on before the Lord and blew with the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.

56
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:49,440
And the armed men went before the priests, who blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came in the ark, and after the ark, and the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets.

57
00:14:49,760 --> 00:15:05,280
And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout.

58
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,800
And the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going about once, and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.

59
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:24,640
And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord, and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets.

60
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:34,000
And the armed men went before them, but the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord, the priests going on and blew them with the trumpets.

61
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,640
And the second day they compassed the city once and returned to the camp.

62
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,320
So they did six days.

63
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,880
And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times.

64
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,040
Only on that day they compassed the city seven times.

65
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:03,120
And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout, for the Lord hath given you the city.

66
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,720
And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are in it to the Lord.

67
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:18,800
Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she did hid the messengers that we sent.

68
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:30,480
And ye in every way, keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it.

69
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,040
But all the silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron are consecrated unto the Lord.

70
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,920
They shall come into the treasure of the Lord.

71
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets.

72
00:16:44,560 --> 00:17:10,480
And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up in the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city, and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.

73
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,440
God and Heavenly Father, take this message.

74
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
Apply it to our hearts in Jesus' name.

75
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,120
Amen.

76
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,440
Triumphant faith and Jericho.

77
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,200
What is triumphant faith?

78
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,680
What is triumphant faith?

79
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:48,720
It is steadfast, unwavering, unfaltering, diligent trust in God from the people of God so that God is moved to perform the impossible and to bring victories in the lives of his people.

80
00:17:50,960 --> 00:18:06,080
There is no obstacle or situation so great or so high or so deep or so broad or so long, oh, so long, that our omnipotent, all-powerful God cannot achieve.

81
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Our all-powerful God can solve and conquer for those who have faith.

82
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Here before us in Joshua chapter 6 and verses 1 through 21 is the story of this conquest of Jericho.

83
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:28,800
And we see through the faith of Israel how God miraculously gave them this closed, unaccessible city.

84
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,720
No one came in or no one went out.

85
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,120
It was closed up.

86
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,320
Totally.

87
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,800
There were no breaches in the walls.

88
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
Everything was in that city.

89
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,120
The cattle, everything.

90
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,520
Their whole life was in that city.

91
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,520
Humanly speaking, the taking of this walled city was utterly impossible.

92
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,160
But God, Almighty God, had promised Israel, his people, that the city would be theirs.

93
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,760
How would they take it?

94
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,320
By faith, in obedience to the commands of God.

95
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:26,560
Just as God miraculously delivered Israel from Egyptian bondage, so he would conquer other enemies that stood in the way of his divine purpose and plan for his people and for the ages to come.

96
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:42,160
From this magnificent recorded incident and reality of Joshua, we see the characteristics of a triumphant faith which triumphs over every obstacle and difficulty.

97
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,640
Notice now the first characteristic of a triumphant faith.

98
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
It is simple in its activity.

99
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:04,400
Sometimes perhaps we imagine that faith is a difficult and a mysterious thing, but is it a difficult thing, a mysterious thing, something that is unknown and unexplainable?

100
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:13,200
Faith, beloved, is simply trusting, taking God at his word, believing him.

101
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
Think here for a moment now.

102
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,480
Jericho was to be captured.

103
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:30,480
It was a walled city, and it would be impossible, even with a gigantic army, to overthrow the walls of the city.

104
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,960
And yet that is exactly what the children of Israel were to do.

105
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
Not with an army, but by faith.

106
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,400
They were simply to trust God to do it for them.

107
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,680
Could anything be more simple than that?

108
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,640
All they had to do was to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.

109
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,600
At the crossing of the Red Sea, you remember, this is exactly what Moses had said to the people.

110
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Fear not.

111
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,120
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show us this day.

112
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,960
For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.

113
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,840
God is the one who performs the miracles.

114
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,320
God is the one who does the impossible.

115
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,080
God is the one who defeats our enemies and overrules in our problems.

116
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,160
We must simply relinquish and let go and believe God that he will do above all that we ask or think.

117
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:52,960
We are to simply stand still in every situation and difficulty and problem of life and see the salvation of the Lord.

118
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:06,800
Listen, beloved, this is fate, the way of victory over all our enemies, over all the world, whether it be the world, the flesh, or the devil.

119
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:16,640
God can and he will do the impossible for us, but human resources are quite insufficient.

120
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,080
And the arm of the flesh is altogether inadequate.

121
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,560
And dear Christian friends, any confidence in the flesh is all in vain.

122
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:40,960
Paul said to the Philippians, for we are the circumcision who worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.

123
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:53,040
We are to simply trust God and believe his word, and the way of victory for life and for service is to take the victory which God gives.

124
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,520
Look at Joshua chapter 6, and we notice verse 16.

125
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:10,000
And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout, for the Lord hath given you the city.

126
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,480
Shout, for God hath given you the victory.

127
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,440
Victory in Christ.

128
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:29,200
In 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 57, the Apostle Paul says, But thanks be unto God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

129
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Every victory that you and I need, beloved, is ours for the taking.

130
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
It is ours for the taking.

131
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,160
How?

132
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
By faith.

133
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,200
Just reaching out, receiving what God will do.

134
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,960
No, victory is not achieved by struggle, by human effort.

135
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,480
It is received and experienced and enjoyed by faith.

136
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3 and verses 5 and 6, not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but sufficiency is of God, who hath made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, not of the law, not of our efforts, but of the Spirit, for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.

137
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,920
By faith in him we triumph in victory.

138
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,240
A second triumph of faith, it is foolish in its explanation.

139
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,320
You know, in our mind's eye, we look at the walled city, huge, thick walls.

140
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,680
I'm not talking about thick walls about that thick.

141
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm talking about way wide by the foot thick.

142
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,840
Closed up tight.

143
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
And there were no breaches in the wall.

144
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,480
There were no tanks or bombs to use.

145
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,960
There was no gigantic army to fight to try to make a breach some way in that wall.

146
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,800
How was there to be victory?

147
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
How were they going to take the city?

148
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,960
And we asked Joshua.

149
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
And Joshua tells us.

150
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,160
He tells us how the victories achieved.

151
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,320
And what does he reply?

152
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:41,360
Looking again at chapter 6 and verses 15 and 16, we read, And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times.

153
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,160
Only on this day they compassed the city seven times.

154
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:57,200
And it came to pass at the seventh time when the people, the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, shout, for the Lord hath given you the city.

155
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,840
Shout, for the Lord hath given you the city.

156
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:11,440
But then someone comes up and he says, and perhaps he steps up and he says, but Joshua, that is foolish.

157
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,640
And Joshua replies, yes, but the wisdom of God is foolishness with men.

158
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:26,720
Paul said that it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

159
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Surely to the natural man, faith is foolishness.

160
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,400
But Joshua said, this is how God is going to accomplish the victory, and we have his word for it.

161
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,160
And so we look back over in the sixth chapter, and we see those verses two through five.

162
00:26:44,320 --> 00:27:26,160
And here the Lord said to Joshua, these men are going, these mighty men, these many men of valor, these war, men of war, and they're going to compass this city, and they're going to go around it six times, or one time for six days, and then on the seventh day, they're going to go around it seven times, and the men are going to go before the Ark of the Covenant, bearing the horns of the ram's horns, trumpets of ram's horn, and on the seventh time around, they're going to blast on the trumpet.

163
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,000
And when they blast on the trumpet and the people hear it, they're going to shout.

164
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,400
And the walls of that city are going to fall down.

165
00:27:39,920 --> 00:28:05,200
For 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verses 25 and 27, we are told also there, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men, verse 27, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.

166
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,920
How foolish faith is to the natural mind.

167
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,480
How foolish to compass a city seven times.

168
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
How foolish for people to shout.

169
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,120
How foolish for the priests to blow the trumpets.

170
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,240
But foolish though it may have seemed, the wall fell down flat.

171
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Was it all their shouting?

172
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,160
Was it all their compassing the city?

173
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,800
Was that what made it fall?

174
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,520
No, it was their faith in God that he would do the impossible.

175
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,960
And they were obedient to his voice.

176
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,080
The faith of God's people triumphed.

177
00:28:52,400 --> 00:29:03,520
And regardless of how foolish the explanation of faith may seem to mankind, just to do as God desires us to do, to believe him and to take him at his word and to obey him.

178
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,440
This is triumphant faith.

179
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,280
And it means victory for us in any and every situation and circumstance.

180
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:22,240
Triumphant faith is foolish in its explanation to the natural mind.

181
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,200
A third characteristic of triumphant faith, it is complete in its obedience.

182
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,680
A careful reading of Joshua chapter 6 reveals that God's instructions were carried out to the very letter.

183
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,160
The people were obedient in faith.

184
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,880
Joshua, the priests, the people did exactly what God commanded them to do.

185
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:54,240
Christian friends, this is a very important mark of the faith that triumphs to obey the Lord.

186
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Not only to hear his voice, but to obey by the step of faith.

187
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:17,360
Sometimes we might ask God to deliver us from some unethical or wicked vice in our life, but we don't obey God's command to forsake the sin.

188
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:31,120
We will not, as Paul said in Ephesians 4, 22, put off concerning the formal conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts.

189
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:41,520
And instead of being God and forsaking the sin and trusting God that he will remove it from our life, what do we do?

190
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,800
We regard the sin or the iniquity in our life.

191
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,880
Thus we triumph not.

192
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,960
We do not triumph.

193
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,280
We have not the victory, for we have not obeyed in faith.

194
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:16,800
There are many examples that could be given where we doubtless have failed to triumph because disobedience in the life or because of doubt and unbelief in the heart.

195
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:30,320
You know, God's word says, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him.

196
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
But let him ask in faith, not wavering.

197
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,800
For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed.

198
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,440
For let not this man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.

199
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,520
How often we are to obey, slow to obey the Lord.

200
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,960
And even when we do set out to do his bidding, our obedience sometimes is only partial.

201
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:23,280
Listen, God wants our full, prompt, glad, unreserved, and unquestioning obedience and how pleasing this is to him and how profitable it is to us.

202
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:40,880
In the book of 2 Samuel, we find there concerning in the Old Testament, in verses 15 of the Old Testament, we find that an example of this, of this kind of obedience.

203
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:51,520
And we're told there, and the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my Lord the king shall appoint.

204
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,760
These servants were ready, willing, and committed to do the king's bidding.

205
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,920
In the Acts chapter 8 and verses 26 to 30, we have a New Testament illustration of this kind of obedience that God wants.

206
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,520
And it has to do with Philip and the eunuch.

207
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:21,280
And the Holy Spirit spoke to Philip to go and join himself to the chariot.

208
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:32,400
And it was that the queen's treasure was in this chariot, and he was reading from the book of Isaiah.

209
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,880
And Philip came along and he says, what is it that you read?

210
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,680
And he said, how do I know if no one tells me?

211
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,720
And an invitation of this eunuch, Philip got up into the chariot and he began to explain to him, beginning where he was reading, and he shared Jesus with him.

212
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,040
And the man come to know the Lord as his Savior.

213
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:10,800
With what willingness and enthusiasm and desire Philip moved in obedience of faith.

214
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,960
But had he not moved in obedience to faith, this man would have been without knowledge.

215
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:31,280
Dear people, if we exercise this kind of obedience, we cannot help but experience the triumph of faith, for triumph of faith is complete in its obedience.

216
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,760
And through obedience to God's commands and to his bidding, we triumph and we have the victory.

217
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,200
Are we obedient?

218
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:55,840
Do we not only hear God's voice, do we move in obedience and following?

219
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,960
A fourth characteristic of triumphant faith, it is perfected in its testing.

220
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:23,840
Certainly, if we project ourselves back in the place where Joshua and the children of Israel stood, surely we can see it must have been a tremendous test of faith for both Joshua and the children of Israel to wait seven days before they saw the victory.

221
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:34,560
Think how fatigued the men of war and the priests would be after compassing the city seven times on the seventh day.

222
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,160
Folks, it wasn't just walking around the church building.

223
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,760
It was walking around a city.

224
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
It wasn't two or three blocks.

225
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,640
It was a city.

226
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,800
It had all their livelihood in the city, and they walked around it seven times.

227
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:09,040
Their strength was at a very low ebb, and their resources were nil.

228
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,840
Nothing completely exhausted.

229
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh, can we see, beloved, these are the conditions necessary before God can give the victories.

230
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:39,280
All our human efforts and all our anxieties and thoughts and presumptions and all of self must be yielded to God and there must be complete humility, total dependence before God.

231
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,080
Why?

232
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,560
The answer is in 1 Corinthians 1, 29, that no flesh should glory in his presence.

233
00:36:49,760 --> 00:37:02,400
When our all, when our very best is laid at the feet of our God and we are wholly and fully dependent upon him, then God can give his victories.

234
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,040
Think for a moment.

235
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:36,880
Can you just imagine, knowing ourselves and how impatient human beings that we are, how hard it must have been for this great host of people to remain silent for seven days, just marching around and around and around this city of Jericho, and then on the seventh day marching around it seven times, yet remaining silent and quiet and patient, leaving the whole situation to the Lord.

236
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,840
Can you imagine?

237
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:52,720
Listen, Christian friends, waiting time is never wasted time when faith is operating and when it is God's will that we do the waiting.

238
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,840
How very true the words of the song are when we reach the end of our hoarded resources.

239
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,080
Our Father's forgiving has only begun.

240
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,720
The faith that triumphs is perfected in its testing.

241
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:26,160
Finally, the characteristic of triumphant faith is a terrible and wonderful in its achievements.

242
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,960
You know it is terrible for the ungodly, but it is wonderful for the people of God.

243
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,040
God's deliverance are always accompanied by judgments.

244
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,240
You see, sin has to be judged before the victory can come.

245
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,880
Sin has to be covered.

246
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,360
It has to be destroyed by the blood of Jesus Christ.

247
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,640
When you come to him in faith and say, Lord, forgive me of my sin, and God wipes it away.

248
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
Then comes the victory in our lives.

249
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,840
Then comes our salvation and our freedom.

250
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:18,480
Let us notice very carefully Joshua chapter 6 and again verses 15 and 16.

251
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:27,360
And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day, encompassed the city after the same manner seven times.

252
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,440
Only this day they compassed the city seven times.

253
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:41,520
And it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout, for the Lord hath given you the city.

254
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,320
Then look at verses 20 and 21.

255
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,760
So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets.

256
00:39:48,080 --> 00:40:03,040
And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him and took the city.

257
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:16,160
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword.

258
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:26,240
All the way through the word of God, we find that when God delivers, there must be judgment.

259
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,960
It was so in the time of the ark, in the case of the ark and the flood.

260
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:45,760
In Genesis 7, 23, it tells us, and every living thing was destroyed, which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth.

261
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,120
And Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

262
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,040
Judgment came when God delivered his people at the Red Sea.

263
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Here they were, the people going across on dry land with the water all up about them, and here came the children of Pharaoh, and they were covered in water.

264
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:21,840
They were utterly destroyed, and the people of Israel, so that day God delivered Israel, and they looked and they saw the dead lying on the shore.

265
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,200
Judgment.

266
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:33,920
Judgment came in this case in the destruction of Jericho and the salvation of those who trusted him.

267
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,280
And my friends, judgment is coming again.

268
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,040
It will be when God's next victory is given.

269
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,760
When will it be?

270
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,040
Surely not very long.

271
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,120
For it will be when the Lord Jesus Christ parts the clouds of blue and sets his feet upon the Mount of Olives.

272
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,000
When he comes, it will mean glory and triumph for his people.

273
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:23,120
1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and verses 16 and 17 tells us, For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the archangel and with a trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and we which remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to forever be with the Lord.

274
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,000
Comfort ye one another with these words.

275
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,600
What a comfort.

276
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,280
Truly, it will be a wonderful day for all who know Jesus Christ.

277
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,880
We shall triumph.

278
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,760
God's victory is given.

279
00:42:40,400 --> 00:43:08,400
But for those who have failed to trust him and have died in their disobedience and sin, even those this day and every day who fail in their sin and their opportunity to receive him, when God's next victory is given, it will mean terrible sorrow and tears and pain and remorse and eternal separation from the Lord forever.

280
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,760
Like Jericho, the unsaved and the ungodly are under condemnation.

281
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:25,040
And the Bible tells us in John 3, 18, he that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already.

282
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:39,040
It follows in John 3, 36, He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.

283
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,880
As we close, turn with me, please, to the book of 2 Thessalonians.

284
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,120
2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

285
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,720
And let's listen carefully to verses 7 through 10.

286
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,280
2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

287
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
Listen to those words.

288
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,640
Beginning with the seventh verse.

289
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,040
Chapter 1.

290
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:51,520
And to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day.

291
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,080
Oh, listen, beloved, the invitation is this.

292
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,600
Come to me, all ye that are troubled and rest with us.

293
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,800
And he says, come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I'll give you rest.

294
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:34,560
Because Christ is coming, and he's going to pour out his vengeance upon all who have not obeyed him, who have rejected him, who have trampled the blood of the cross under their feet and for those who will not hear and obey the gospel.

295
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,240
And beloved, there's so many out there today who are without Christ and they know him not.

296
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
And they will not hear.

297
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,360
They will not repent because they're wrapped up in themselves and all that's around them.

298
00:45:52,240 --> 00:46:00,560
God is going to come and all his vengeance against sin.

299
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:09,040
Dear friend, today, if you're here and you're not ready to meet the Lord Jesus Christ, then you need to get ready.

300
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:24,960
For you know not the moment or the hour or the day or the time when you could be snatched out in eternity and your opportunity is gone forever.

301
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,360
Gone forever.

302
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:39,680
Surely if you're here unprepared, this should be a sobering moment in your life in which you count the cost and you say, oh God, here I stand and I'm not sure that I'm a child of God.

303
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,240
I'm not sure that I'm born in your kingdom.

304
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm not sure I'm going to heaven.

305
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,080
God wants to talk to you and he wants to speak to you.

306
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,640
He says, come to me.

307
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,560
Come to me and I'll give you rest.

308
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,320
I'll give you life.

309
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,880
I'll give you eternal peace.

310
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,440
Why would we turn that away?

311
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:16,080
Why would men constantly and every day turn their heart against God and against his wonderful word and his gospel and his truth and his love?

312
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,240
It's hard to understand.

313
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,000
But if you know not Christ today, this is your opportunity.

314
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:34,800
This is your time to just deal with this in your life and in the moment you can make a decision for him.

315
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,400
Young people, a lot of you sitting on that back road, do you know Jesus?

316
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,040
Are you satisfied you go to heaven when God calls you?

317
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,360
If you don't, he wants to save you.

318
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,080
And all you need to do is by faith.

319
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,440
That's what we've been talking about.

320
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,240
Faith.

321
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Simply step out of faith.

322
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,000
Coming down that aisle is not going to save you.

323
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,880
But coming down that aisle in faith in Jesus Christ, that will save you.

324
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,720
Are you needy?

325
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,000
Are you lost today?

326
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,080
Or are you only going to have it?

327
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,400
God says, give me life.

328
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:38,000
And then if you have trusted Christ as your Savior today, my friend, how grateful you should feel that the Lord this day, that you have been led through grace to trust him as your triumphant Savior.

329
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,160
Oh, the triumph.

330
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,360
That is in the heart of the believer.

331
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
We have the victory.

332
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,880
It was finished on the cross of Calvary.

333
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,480
Do you know it today?

334
00:48:59,680 --> 00:48:59,920
Trust.

335
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:00,880
Let's pray.

336
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,760
God and Heavenly Father, how we just thank you for your gracious love.

337
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:17,760
How we thank you, O God, for your long-suffering mercy and for your grace that was given unto us, undeserving as we are.

338
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:28,960
And yet, oh God, you loved us so much that you gave your life and you gave it that every person who would come to you by faith might trust.

339
00:49:32,880 --> 00:52:08,720
Oh God, if there's a person who does the word that does it, all my soul and all peace with thee soul.

340
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,600
You would take your handles, please, now, and turn with me to 159.

341
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,960
There is power in the blood.

342
00:54:51,360 --> 00:55:00,160
Most gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you this day with grateful hearts and joy, O Lord, of most of all, for just knowing you.

343
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:16,320
We ask, O God, that our hearts might be open to your will, open to your voice, that we might hear what you want us to hear today, that we might in turn go out to Jesus and tell others about him.

344
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:24,720
Guide us, Lord, strengthen us, lift us up, that we may sing praises to our Lord with joyful hearts.

345
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,840
In his name we pray.

346
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:57,440
I praise that great beggar.

347
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,960
Please be seated.

348
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,640
It says, We look to God in prayer.

349
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,920
Lord Jesus, we come to you again and we pause before you to give you praise and honor and glory.

350
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,840
Dear Father, we thank you for everyone who is here today.

351
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,000
And we just ask, oh God, that your Holy Spirit would give us hearts and love and compassion for you.

352
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,720
Give us insight and wisdom, O Lord, as we would seek to please you.

353
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,720
Seek, O God, how we can be better witnesses for you.

354
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:47,520
We go out into the highways and the byways and tell people about Jesus, not taking them by the neck and tell them about pouring salvation down them, O God.

355
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:55,440
Just let our lives exemplify the Lord Jesus and let our lives speak of what Christ has done for us.

356
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:10,160
That we're born again in his kingdom, not by anything we've done, not by any merit of ours, but by just because of the gracious love and mercy of our living God, sending his Son, the Lord Jesus, to die for our sins.

357
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:18,880
To make it possible that we by faith are ushered into the kingdom of God and in his love.

358
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,560
We pray, O God, today that you would just touch every life.

359
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,880
God, we realize there are many that aren't here with us this morning.

360
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,440
Lord, we praise you for those who are here, and may each of us have open hearts.

361
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:40,480
And then, Lord, we just pray, O God, for those that are unable to be with us today, those who are ill and have incapacitated.

362
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:51,600
So, Lord, we just pray that you would just pray, dear Father, that they may feel your presence and your joy in their lives.

363
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,720
We pray especially for the roses, oh, God, to be very near to them, and may they feel your presence and your joy.

364
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,160
Lord, we just pray, dear, Father, for Susan Recruger, Lord, and we thank you for the improvement for her.

365
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,840
And we look forward, O God, to today when she is back with us.

366
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:25,760
We praise you, Lord, that your grace is sufficient for us, that there is nothing to heart to God, that he is the great physician, the one who heals not only our ailments and our pains, O God, but that he heals the heart and the soul and makes us new creatures in South.

367
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,280
Lord, we pray today.

368
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,040
Touch every light.

369
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,000
Touch us, O God, with the filling of the filling of your spirit anew and afresh.

370
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,360
May we go forth with the power of God as we go forth to serve you.

371
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:34,480
God will stand every man, and we cannot understand all the ways that God would lead us to the blessed promised land.

372
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:40,880
But He'll guide us with His arm, and we'll follow till we die.

373
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:53,600
We will understand with them far and love and fall when the morning comes.

374
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:27,440
When the saints of God are the story of the love to come, we will understand it better than morning comes Temptation to speak something.

375
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,600
We will understand it better, God and God.

376
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:22,720
We will understand it better, God and By God, amen.

377
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:34,640
When we change our services around just a little bit, it just seems to get me confused, and it seems to rub off on the others, too.

378
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:47,280
But I'm so grateful to you today that you are here for this time with Brother Terry Douglas and the Sharing Jesus.

379
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,840
And I enjoyed it so much this morning already.

380
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,240
You know, we want to make this something that is practical.

381
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,000
That's what Sharing Jesus is.

382
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,120
It's a practical thing.

383
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,920
You go out and just be yourself and tell what Jesus does to you.

384
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,760
You just can't take it down and wrote it and say, this is the way I'm going to do it.

385
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,520
You can't be formal.

386
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,200
You've got to just let Christ show himself through you.

387
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,080
It was a great delight yesterday as we were down at the Stand in the Gap.

388
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,000
And yes, I believe there was a million men there.

389
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,040
The media won't say so, probably.

390
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,960
But there were lots of men there everywhere you see.

391
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,640
And God was glorified.

392
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
That's the purpose of that men's meeting.

393
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,520
To give God the glory, to lift him up, that the world around might see that Jesus truly lives.

394
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:49,920
He doesn't only just live and sitting at the right hand of the Father, but he lives in the hearts of men and women, boys and girls around the world.

395
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,720
Many more needy.

396
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,160
And so we praise the Lord for that time.

397
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,000
And I'm not going to go on, brother.

398
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,040
I'm going to quit right here.

399
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,760
But we do want to recognize our guests this morning.

400
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,440
I'm glad that you're here.

401
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,520
And I just trust that your hearts will be blessed by the Lord.

402
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,800
We have a brother here from North Carolina originally.

403
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,600
Cyrus Ridge and his dear wife, Norma, and their residents here in town.

404
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,120
We're just happy to have you today.

405
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,880
May God bless you and worship.

406
01:04:22,160 --> 01:05:00,000
Brother Perry, I'm not going to be able to do that.
