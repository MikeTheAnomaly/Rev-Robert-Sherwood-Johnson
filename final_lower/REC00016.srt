1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:22,960
By the grace we can find in heaven, there are no losers.

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:01:35,680
In heaven us, the hopeless cause there's only people like you with feelings like me and we're amazed by the grace we can find in heaven Good morning.

3
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,880
I would like to share a special thank you.

4
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,720
I'm sure that you feel much the same as I do for the young people from Student Home Dewey.

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
They put in a lot of time and effort in preparing this morning's service.

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,920
And a special thanks to Mickey and Brandon and Jennifer, Rayanna, Justin, Sue Haiti, and Matthew.

7
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
You were excellent.

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,800
Very proud of you.

9
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,560
And you have a chance to say hello to them and thank them for what it is that they have shared with you this morning.

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,120
I would like to acknowledge the two young ladies that are seated up on stage.

11
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:36,160
First of all, Renee is a missionary serving in a special school for 40 Mexican children near Ensenado, a city in Mexico, not too far out of the United States.

12
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,240
And she works with children who are deaf.

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,320
As you notice, she shared the words to the music in some of our songs this morning with signing.

14
00:02:47,200 --> 00:03:00,080
And the other young lady that just presented a solo for us and has been very, very instrumental in a special service this morning for us with her singing is Sherry Johnson.

15
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,480
Sherry is a junior at Bloomsburg State University majoring in psychology.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
And we thank both of you young ladies very much for your assistance.

17
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,000
The proud house parents of Student Home Dewey, of course, I think they can be very proud for the efforts of the young people.

18
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,040
And I know Mrs.

19
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Johnson and Mr.

20
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Johnson, who have been with the school for a number of years, I know the kind of work and effort that it takes in preparing these young people for this morning.

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
I'd like to now present our morning speaker, Mr.

22
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
Johnson, student home, Dewey, House Father.

23
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,080
Good morning.

24
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,000
You know, I didn't know the occasion would happen to arise that I would have this privilege to speak to the congregation here.

25
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,080
It is a congregation.

26
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,960
But it's my pleasure today, and it's a joy to share in the wonderful word of God.

27
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,960
How big is God's love?

28
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:24,720
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

29
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,440
You know, there's no other verse in the whole Bible that is quoted more than John 3, 16.

30
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,840
Most all children that have ever been to church for any period of time can recite this verse.

31
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,840
And most church adults, whether they can recite it or not, can tell you basically the contents of the verse.

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:55,360
The question is, how many times has the verse been flippantly quoted in like-mindedness with no proper seriousness?

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:07,520
The most familiar, the most quoted verse in the whole Bible, and yet for the majority of the people in the United States of America alone, it bears little significance.

34
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
It's flippantly heard, and it's flippantly passed by.

35
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,200
What does John 3, 16 really say?

36
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,760
What does it mean to us today?

37
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:30,880
First of all, as we read this verse, we realize that it was inspired and written so man could have a knowledge of salvation and be saved from his sin.

38
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,520
For man, you see, is lost.

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,480
He became a lost sinner by a look way back in the Garden of Eden.

40
00:05:40,800 --> 00:06:00,640
The first thing recorded of Eve in connection with the fall of our first parents is in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 6, which says, The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and looking upon that tree, she took of the fruit in disobedience to God's command, and sin entered her heart.

41
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,960
And just as man became lost by a look, in like manner the lost sinner is saved by a look.

42
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,000
The Christian life begins by looking.

43
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Looking in faith and trust to the Son of God who paid our debt and wrought our pardon on Calvary's cross.

44
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,600
Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is none else.

45
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,760
Isaiah 45, 22.

46
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
For God so loved the world.

47
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,160
For a moment, let us think on the thought, who is God?

48
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
John 4, 24 says that God is a Spirit.

49
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,360
God is infinite and eternal and unchangeable in his being.

50
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,960
He is wisdom and power and holiness.

51
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,880
He is justice and goodness and truth.

52
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,960
And more, he is omniscient.

53
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
He knows all things.

54
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
He is omnipotent.

55
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,480
He is all-powerful.

56
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,640
He is omnipresent.

57
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,720
He is everywhere.

58
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
He is supreme.

59
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,200
He is serene.

60
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,320
He is king of kings.

61
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
He's Lord of lords.

62
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,800
He's everything.

63
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,280
And all the adjectives in the world could be exhausted, and still we could not describe all that God is.

64
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,440
And think of it.

65
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:36,640
Being all that he is, holy and perfect and infinitely greater than we, yet God so loved the world.

66
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
The words of a song express it.

67
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
The love of God is greater far than tucker pen can ever tell.

68
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,480
It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell.

69
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
The guilty pair, bowed down with care, God gave his son to win.

70
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
His erring child he reconciled and pardoned from his sin.

71
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:12,560
Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong, it shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels' song.

72
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,640
The love of God.

73
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,920
How this phrase blesses the hearts of Christians.

74
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
Only believers can truly appreciate it, and yet they so very imperfectly.

75
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,120
In John chapter 3 and verse 16, again, there are seven things I would like for us to notice and breathe about God's love.

76
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
So listen, if you would.

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,040
First of all, we see the tense of God's love.

78
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,560
God so loved the world.

79
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Here it is not that God loves, but that God loved.

80
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:54,480
The fact that he loves us now, that we come to know him by faith and trust in his only begotten son, this, in a measure, we can understand.

81
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:04,000
But the fact that he loved us before we come to know him as our Savior surpasses our understanding, doesn't it?

82
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,200
But he did.

83
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,640
In Romans 5, 8, we read, But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

84
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,520
Jeremiah 31, 3, Yes, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee.

85
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,400
So we see the tense of God's love.

86
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
God so loved the world.

87
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:37,760
Secondly, we note the magnitude of God's love, the greatness of his love, the fullness of his love.

88
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,560
For God so loved the world.

89
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
You know, God loved with such great love that he so loved.

90
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,240
No one can ever define or measure this little word so.

91
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,320
Just a little two-letter word, and yet so rich and full with meaning.

92
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
God so loved the world.

93
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,520
The following words were penciled on the wall of an insane asylum by a man who was demented or mentally ill.

94
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:24,400
And he wrote, Could we with ink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made, were every stalk on earth a quill, and every man a scribe by trade?

95
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,320
To write the love of God above would drain the oceans dry.

96
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,360
Nor could the scroll contain the whole, though stretched from sky to sky.

97
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,840
O love of God, how rich and pure, how measure less and strong.

98
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,000
It shall forevermore endure the saints and angels' song.

99
00:10:51,120 --> 00:11:00,960
There are dimensions to the breadth and length and depth and height of God's great and wondrous love that none can ever measure it.

100
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,080
But I believe that the nearest means of measuring the love of God is found right in the next thing we see about God's love.

101
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,840
And this is the scope of his love.

102
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,480
How big is God's love?

103
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,840
For God so loved the world.

104
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,160
Yes, the scope of God's love is the world.

105
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:34,240
And although we cannot measure the love of God, we can see in our mind's eye the far-reaching expanse of the love and the greatness of his unmerited love.

106
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
Did I say unmerited?

107
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,440
That's right.

108
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,120
Unmerited love.

109
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,160
Oh, you see, the world certainly didn't merit God's love.

110
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,640
The world didn't earn it.

111
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,880
He freely loved us.

112
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,600
And as we look at the word world, we are made aware that God's love is not limited.

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,000
It was not limited to the narrow bounds of Israel or just to the Jewish people or even to us here in the United States.

114
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,280
God's love reaches out to the world.

115
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,760
In the Greek language, the word for world in this usage is cosmos, which means universal.

116
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:39,200
God's love reaches out to the ends of the earth, flowing out to sinners of the whole universe, to the bushmen of Africa, to the Peruvians of South America, to the atheists of communist China, communist Russia, to the Muslim world, to the Buddhist in China, to the Hindu in India, and on and on we could go.

117
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
God loves the whole world.

118
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,480
God is concerned about the whole world.

119
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
And think of it.

120
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,920
If God is concerned for the whole world, how much more is he concerned for those that are believers in the world?

121
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:09,600
God knows when a sparrow falls from the air to the ground, how much more are we to him than the sparrows?

122
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,440
How big is God's love?

123
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,560
The world.

124
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,960
The fourth thing we notice is the nature of God's love.

125
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,080
For God so loved the world that he gave.

126
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,200
Yes, God's love is a giving love.

127
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,200
The glorious nature of God's love was perfect and real.

128
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,440
It is only the perfect, real love that ever seeks the highest interest of others.

129
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
And God's highest interest is a lost sinner.

130
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
He gave all for him.

131
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,360
God's love is unselfish and long-suffering.

132
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
His love has no limit.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,080
His grace has no measure.

134
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,080
His power has no boundary known unto men.

135
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,480
For out of his infinite riches in Jesus, he giveth and giveth and giveth again.

136
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
God's nature is to give.

137
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
And he gave the best for you.

138
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
And he gave his best for me.

139
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,360
And he gave his best for the whole world.

140
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,960
What did he give?

141
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,920
In the fifth place, we see the sacrificial character of God's love.

142
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,520
There had to be a sacrifice, and God gave his only begotten son.

143
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,360
Isn't that wonderful?

144
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,280
God gave his son that you and I might live.

145
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,680
God sacrificed his most treasured possession for us.

146
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:59,840
Without reservation, that this sacrifice was his only begotten son, God gave him as a gift to a world of cruel, unmerciful, wicked sinners who cursed him and mocked him and slapped him and spat upon him and plucked out his beard and then nailed him to a cross.

147
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:14,480
And God in his sovereignty, knowing that man would curse and mock and finally nail his son to the cross, still he gave him, that he would die for you and me and the whole world.

148
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,840
The Bible says that love is strong as death.

149
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
Solomon 8, 6.

150
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,760
And because God had such love as this, he was willing to see his only begotten son crucified in order that we might live.

151
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:40,800
In Romans chapter 8 and verse 32, we read, He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

152
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,160
The Apostle Paul wrote, Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

153
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
God spared not his best for us.

154
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,080
The sixth thing we would find in John 3, 16 is the design of God's great love.

155
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,080
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish.

156
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,560
The design of God's great love is to draw all men unto himself.

157
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:22,560
If you turned to the 21st chapter of the book of Numbers in the Bible, you would find the story about the poisonous serpents that came and were biting the Israelites there in the wilderness because of their disobedience.

158
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,280
Everyone that was bitten agonized in pain as the poison began circulating through his system.

159
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:44,880
But because of God's great love for his people, he instructed Moses to lift up a serpent of brass so that all they that would turn and look upon it could be healed and live.

160
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:59,440
No matter how many times one may have been bitten, no matter how far the poison had advanced in its progress toward a fatal issue, if he but looked, he should live.

161
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:07,760
Such is the gospel declaration here in John 3.16, Whosoever believeth in him should not perish.

162
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,400
You see, God's love is so big that it reaches out to everyone.

163
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,520
It makes no difference who you are, for whosoever believeth in him shall not perish.

164
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,320
It makes no difference how dead in trespasses and sins you are.

165
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:36,800
It makes no difference how many times Satan has attacked you and deceived you, nor how fatal the sting of sin has progressed in your life.

166
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:48,960
If you but look with a look of faith to the Son of God who was lifted up on Calvary's cross, for you you shall live.

167
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,120
In the opening verses of John chapter 3, we find Jesus dealing with a man, Nicodemus.

168
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,160
And he's been speaking to Nicodemus about the imperative necessity of the new birth.

169
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:09,120
In verse 14, Jesus said, And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.

170
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,840
Why?

171
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,840
That men and women and boys and girls might look with the eyes of faith and live.

172
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:28,480
Did you know that on that day when Moses lifted up that serpent of brass, that many still died in their sins and their pains?

173
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,440
Because they simply refused to turn by faith and look upon that serpent of brass.

174
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,720
They died in unbelief.

175
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,600
Many today are dying just like they did because of the sin of unbelief.

176
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,040
Many died in the wilderness from the bites of the serpents.

177
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:57,040
And many of Adam's race will suffer eternal death and torment and separation from God forever.

178
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,000
But this is not God's desire.

179
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
This is not God's design.

180
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,880
For he purposed to have a people who should not perish.

181
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:16,960
2 Peter 3.9 says, The Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

182
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,960
Have you repented of your sin and turned to Jesus Christ by faith?

183
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,800
Finally, let us see the seventh attribute of God's great love.

184
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:42,880
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

185
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,720
You see, the beneficience of God's love is everlasting life.

186
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,040
This is what God imparts to every one of his own.

187
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,040
Oh, how he longs to impart this gift upon every person in this world today.

188
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,160
And if you've never asked Christ to be your Savior, God longs to impart to your life his salvation.

189
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,880
But you know many will not take the look of faith and put their trust in Jesus Christ and ask him to come into their life and be their Savior.

190
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
Oh, what a privilege men have today to inherit a gift for eternity.

191
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:38,320
And yet many turn it aside and they turn it down for the pleasures of sin for a season and pass to their eternal dome apart from God forever.

192
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,080
Have you ever taken the look of faith to the Son of God who can take away your sins?

193
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,760
Why not?

194
00:20:49,120 --> 00:21:01,840
Remember God spared not his best for you, but gave him up freely to die on that cross because, you see, he loved you more than he loved his only begotten Son.

195
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
Let us exclaim with St.

196
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,640
John the Apostle, behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us.

197
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,040
How big is God's love?

198
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,480
Oh, God's love is so big that it reaches all the way from heaven's glory.

199
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,800
And it reaches right down into the hearts of men and women and boys and girls and young people.

200
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,960
And we feel his work.

201
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
And we feel his presence.

202
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
And we feel his power.

203
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,880
And we feel his peace.

204
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
And we feel his joy.

205
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
And we feel his love.

206
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:54,080
And we hear his voice calling unto us, Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

207
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:05,040
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

208
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,720
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

209
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,040
Oh, everyone that is thirsty in spirit.

210
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, everyone that is weak and spirit to the fountain that is goodness.

211
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,120
I will pour water on him who is the sea.

212
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:24,960
I will put blood upon the dry grass for the gift I am free.

213
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,280
I will be far.

214
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,280
Child of the world, are you tired of your bondage?

215
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:59,280
Weary of earth's joys, so false, so untrue, thirsting for God and his fullness, a blessing.

216
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,600
Listen to the promise, a message for you.

217
00:24:07,120 --> 00:30:02,800
Jordan of the kingdom be filled with us thy love and we can do it for life and for service the prophet so sweet I whip for water on him who is thirsty upon the dry grass for the king Will you please rise for the closing grant we ask of thee almighty God that the words music and songs which we have heard this day with our outward ears may through thy grace be so grafted inwardly in our hearts that they may bring forth in us the fruit of good living to the honor and praise of thy name through Christ our Lord amen He gave his only son to darkness free of sin to set me free Someday something bad what we were
