1
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,120
I like the change to chapter 5 or 2.

2
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:45,680
Before we go to break, I just want to remember those requests that you'll have to have the package here.

3
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,240
I just appreciate so very much the distribution of that.

4
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,080
I don't know what you expect from me.

5
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:25,200
You know, that's what you need to do.

6
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,120
I could change the switchboard.

7
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:37,840
It's a bit straight up before you're not sure the capabilities.

8
01:31:45,040 --> 01:32:08,560
I think you work if we can patch up the screen.

9
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,200
We know that we patch the fly.
