1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
The love of Jesus to a world in need.

2
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,000
Guide us through this hour.

3
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
Bless our time together.

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,440
Bless the words that go forth.

5
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
Touch hearts, O God, who need you most right now.

6
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:20,800
There's people here today who need Jesus Christ as Savior, Lord, who may not leave this building without coming and talking to this pastor or to another person who knows Jesus and give their heart and life to you.

7
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,080
Oh, what a difference it is to walk with Jesus, to know that we're on our way to heaven.

8
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
In Jesus' name.

9
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:33,920
I can never quite explain all the blessings they could be came into my sister.

10
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Thank you, Cora.

11
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,920
That was great.

12
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,920
I appreciate you.

13
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
The car is growing again.

14
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
Four men up there this morning.

15
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
How many ladies up there?

16
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,360
I don't know, but it was all over.

17
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
And that looks good.

18
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Two roads.

19
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
Praise the Lord for that.

20
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
Praise the Lord for their singing.

21
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,720
If you take your Bibles this morning, please, and turn with me to the book of Hebrews chapter 11.

22
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Hebrews chapter 11.

23
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,480
And we're going to be reading verses 23 through 27.

24
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,800
In fact, the same scripture we used last Sunday.

25
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Again, today we read.

26
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
Verse 23.

27
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,080
By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.

28
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:36,080
By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, estaming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.

29
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,640
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.

30
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,680
Let us pray, God and Heavenly Father, hide this feeble speaker behind the cross.

31
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
May Jesus Christ be seen.

32
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
In him, we pray.

33
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,680
Amen.

34
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,360
You know, there's only two kinds of people.

35
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,840
One is a believer, and the other is one who does not believe.

36
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,600
There are men and women in the world who live faith, and it operates through their lives.

37
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
There are also men and women in whose lives faith does not operate.

38
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
It's simple as that.

39
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,680
In the Bible, these classes are called believers and unbelievers.

40
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,560
From our studies of faith here in this book of Hebrews, chapter 11, we've seen faith at the beginning of life and faith at the end of life.

41
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:48,640
The Holy Spirit has so guided the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews so that to inform the reader and the student of the word that the principle of faith should be at work in the whole of the period between the beginning and the end of life.

42
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:57,120
For believers then, the very principle of life, of our life, is the principle of faith.

43
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,280
We live by faith.

44
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:17,040
In other words, at the new birth, when we're born into the kingdom of God, we are literally to live day by day, year by year, by faith until the end is come when our faith is lost in sight of the glorious presence of our Lord and Savior.

45
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,000
Romans 1.17 says, the just shall live by faith.

46
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,760
In Galatians 2.20, the Apostle Paul tells us, I am crucified with Christ.

47
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,400
Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

48
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
And the life which I now live in the flesh, how do I live it?

49
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,800
I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

50
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,640
Another aspect of faith that we have seen in these studies is its progressive nature.

51
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,280
How it begins in a very small way and grows until it becomes great.

52
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Oh, beloved, the purpose of these experiences of faith that are recorded here in this book of Hebrews is for edification, that we may be built up in faith, that our faith, which begins small like a grain of mustard seed, might grow strong and great.

53
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,720
From Luke chapter 17 in verse 5, we read, And the apostle said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

54
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:30,800
My, how it must please the Lord, how he loves to be able to say, even he said, as he said unto the Serophoenician woman, O woman, great is thy faith.

55
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,000
On the other hand, how sadden it must make him when he has to say, O ye of little faith.

56
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,560
From Hebrews 11, verses 23 through 27, we want to think now on the reasonableness of faith.

57
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
The reasonableness of faith.

58
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,600
Is it reasonable to trust in God?

59
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:04,080
From the portion of Scripture, certainly there are reasons to be found why every man and woman, every boy and girl on the face of this earth should trust in God.

60
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,720
It's responsible.

61
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,800
It is reasonable.

62
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,920
It is logical.

63
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Furthermore, it is beneficial.

64
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,680
It's beneficial to trust in the Lord.

65
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,440
First, it is reasonable to trust in God, more reasonable than to fear any earthly ruler or power.

66
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,720
To reason about a thing is to sit down and to count the cost.

67
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
Sit down and count the cost.

68
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,840
In other words, one asks himself, what will it be the result?

69
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,160
What will be the outcome of my acting this way or that?

70
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,880
In Hebrews 11, 23, we find that Moses' parents hid him for three months.

71
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,640
And they were not afraid of the king's commandment.

72
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
They reasoned in their hearts about this thing.

73
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:10,160
And they came to realize that it was more reasonable to trust God and to act in accordance to the convictions and directions that he had placed in their lives and in their hearts than it was to follow the edict of the king.

74
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,960
These God-fearing parents, they knew that the king had power to bring physical death to them.

75
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:31,680
But they also knew that the God who had the power of life and death, the power of eternal life and eternal death, and they chose to trust and obey the Lord, not the king of Egypt.

76
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:47,760
Peter and John, in response to the commandment of the Sanhedrin to speak not in the name of Jesus, they said to them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, you be the judge.

77
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,000
But we cannot help but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

78
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:01,440
These two apostles knew it was more reasonable to trust in God than to fear earthly power and rules.

79
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:10,000
In verse 27 of Hebrews 11, we read concerning Moses himself that he did not fear the wrath of the king.

80
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,680
He forsook Egypt, realizing what might be the consequences for him.

81
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,760
He chose the suffering and the affliction of the people because he reasoned in his heart, he counted the cost.

82
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,640
He saw the final end in view.

83
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,080
And as the words of verse 27 in our text tells us, he endured as seeing him who is invisible.

84
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:43,840
Moses knew it was more reasonable to trust in God because God was greater than the power of any king of Egypt.

85
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,480
There are thousands of our fellow believers today who are suffering terrible persecution.

86
00:14:50,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Many of them have even faced and suffered death itself because their convictions that God is far greater than any earthly monarch and that it is absolutely safe to trust in him, though to do so may incite the wrath of the king or the powers that be.

87
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
Are there people in our day who are suffering persecution?

88
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,000
Absolutely.

89
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Many are dying for the faith because they know it's better to trust in God.

90
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,840
You see, they have a hope.

91
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
A hope that is eternal, that eternal hope.

92
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,680
They're going to be with Jesus when they die.

93
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, to suffer for his sake.

94
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,200
What a blessing.

95
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,680
Certainly it is more reasonable to trust God than to fear any earthly ruler or power.

96
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Proverbs 21 and verse 1, it tells us, the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.

97
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,600
Like the rivers of water, he turneth it whithersoever he will.

98
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:01,200
Secondly, it is reasonable to trust in God because it must be right to refuse that which is wrong.

99
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,040
There's no doubt or question that the right thing is to trust in God.

100
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:19,120
When we are in doubt or in question about anything, let us not eat or partake thereof, lest we be condemned within our own hearts and consciences before the Lord.

101
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Hebrews 11, 24 tells us of Moses' great refusal.

102
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.

103
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,520
He refused to the temptation of sin and lust that he could have participated in.

104
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,600
He refused to seek after pleasure that any sinful heart longs for.

105
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Moses said, are these things right for me?

106
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,040
And the answer pounded back in his soul and his heart, no, these things aren't right for me.

107
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
A great refusal indeed he made.

108
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:10,000
And it serves to remind us that we too are frequently thrust into situations where we simply have to ask ourselves the question, is it right for me, a child of God, a believer, to do this thing or to go this place or to participate in this event?

109
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,400
And the answer to these questions is really very clear.

110
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:24,480
Simply because it cannot be other than right for us to refuse what we know in our heart to be wrong.

111
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:33,600
So it's reasonable to trust in Christ because it must be right to refuse that which is wrong.

112
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:45,840
Thirdly, it is reasonable to trust in God because there's always profit in suffering if suffering is born for the sake of right.

113
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
The word is very clear.

114
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,880
If we trust in God, we're going to have to suffer.

115
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,720
Jesus said in John 15, 11, if the world hate you, you know that they hated me before they hated you.

116
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,480
Psalms 34, 19 says, many are the afflictions of the righteous.

117
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,800
2 Timothy 3.12 says, Yea, and all they that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

118
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,880
Beloved, if we do the right thing, we may have to suffer.

119
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:36,800
But if suffering comes upon us as a result of our trust and our faithfulness and our fidelity to Christ, there will always be a fruitful outcome which will be for the glory of God as well as for our own ultimate blessing.

120
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,800
God, as well as for our own ultimate blessing.

121
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,200
What does Jesus say to these that are his?

122
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:58,720
In Matthew 5, 10 through 12, he says these words, Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God.

123
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:07,440
Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

124
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven.

125
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:24,480
Moses chose to suffer affliction with the people of God, and he chose the reproach of Christ as greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt.

126
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,800
O beloved of God, how reasonable, how logical is it to trust God for the sake of right.

127
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,600
Moses saw this and he saw the benefits it offered.

128
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,480
He had respect, the Bible says, unto the recompense of the reward.

129
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,680
My friend, have you chosen to suffer with Christ?

130
00:19:49,200 --> 00:20:00,320
How reasonable to you to find within your soul to be tongue-lashed by the world and cursed and reviled and laughed at by those about you.

131
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,800
Have you ever experienced that?

132
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, have I experienced it?

133
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,840
More than one time have I experienced it, but I'd rather have Jesus than anything.

134
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,680
I count it a privilege here to serve him and his cross to bear.

135
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,080
Fellow Christian, have you ever noticed Philippians 1.29?

136
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,160
What does it say to us?

137
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:36,720
It says, For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.

138
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
What a blessing.

139
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:48,640
What a great and wonderful privilege it is to take the gift of suffering from his hand, for it always carries with it very much blessing.

140
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,320
From Hebrews 12, 11, we're told, Now, no chastening for the moment seemeth to be joyous, but grievous.

141
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:05,760
Nevertheless, afterward, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

142
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Listen to the words of 1 Peter chapter 4 and verses 12 through 14.

143
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:20,720
And it says here, Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to test you as though some strange thing happened unto you.

144
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:30,640
But rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering, that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

145
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,080
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the Spirit of glory and of the God resteth upon you.

146
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,040
On their part, he is evil spoken of.

147
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,720
But on your part, he is glorified.

148
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Oh, today many servants of God are experiencing suffering and privation.

149
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,760
And they are doing this in behalf of Christ for his sake.

150
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,880
What a privilege it will be for us should we be called to follow in their steps.

151
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,320
Are you ready?

152
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,280
If God calls upon you or me or you or you or you or you, are you ready?

153
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
Are you ready to suffer for his sake?

154
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
Will you lay down your life for Jesus?

155
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,200
How much are we willing to bear the reproach of Christ rather than to deny him?

156
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:33,280
Fourthly, it is reasonable to trust in God because any pleasure enjoyed in the wrong path is only for a season.

157
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,360
It's only for a little time.

158
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,120
In Hebrews 11, 25, we're told that the pleasures of sin are but for a season.

159
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,840
And of course, this pleasure of sin here was in reference to the riches and to the dignities of Pharaoh's court.

160
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,800
And Moses could no longer enjoy these things without being unfaithful to God and his people.

161
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:03,680
And to have gone on living in the palace would be despising Jehovah and the covenant God made with Abraham.

162
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,640
To have continued on in his position would have been selfishness on the part of Moses.

163
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,080
He would have been conducting himself as a whirling rather than a stranger and a pilgrim in this scene.

164
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,120
And he would have been conniving at Pharaoh's cruel treatment of the Hebrews.

165
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:33,200
Yes, if Moses had resisted the impulses of the Spirit in his heart, he would have sinned greatly.

166
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,400
The riches and the dignities in the court of Pharaoh in themselves were not wrong.

167
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,480
There's nothing wrong with a person being wealthy.

168
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:57,760
There's nothing wrong with a person getting ahead, unless these things have become so and used or enjoyed at the wrong time.

169
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:15,840
If Moses had chosen to remain as he was while his brethren were suffering affliction, if he would have relaxed in his personal ease and comfort while his own people were in need of a helping hand, it would have been grievous sin.

170
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,960
Christian friends, this is a picture of the fact that the pleasures of sin are but for a season.

171
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,240
And then they're over.

172
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,920
Then what?

173
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:38,400
Material things and the luxuries of life and other things that capture the minds and the hearts of men are going to pass away.

174
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,680
They are temporal.

175
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
They're not lasting.

176
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,320
Material things of this world have a way of becoming snares.

177
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Have they become a snare in your life?

178
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,160
They become a snare because they are used without temperance.

179
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,640
They are indulged in by the mind of the flesh and not by the mind of the Spirit.

180
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
Listen, there's so many.

181
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,680
In fact, the majority in the world today are seeking their happiness in the things of the flesh rather than in the things of the spirit.

182
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,520
And the scripture says, better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith.

183
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,680
Truly, the pleasures of sin are only for a season.

184
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:40,800
Christian friends, we should not ever try to persuade a worldly person that he cannot find pleasure in the world, in worldliness, and in serving the devil.

185
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
Of course he can.

186
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
Of course he can enjoy it.

187
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
This is all the sinner knows.

188
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,640
But what he does need to realize is that the pleasures is for a season only.

189
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:08,160
And so our place as Christians is to take the precious word of God and by his grace try to show the sinner, man, the reasonableness of trusting God instead of seeking after the pleasures of sin that will not last.

190
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,080
Are we doing that?

191
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,600
You know, we don't always have the opportunities.

192
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,080
Sometimes the door is shut in our face.

193
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,360
Sometimes we can only say, well, thank you.

194
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,840
It's been good to visit you.

195
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,480
God's eternal pleasures are so different.

196
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,880
The psalmist said in Psalm 16, 11, At thy right hand are pleasures forevermore.

197
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:44,480
They are pleasures that go on and on and on through the ages of eternity.

198
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,080
The worldly enjoys those things which give pleasure to the old man.

199
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:01,360
Romans 6, 6 tells us, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

200
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:12,320
Ephesians 4, 22 says, that ye put off concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust.

201
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,960
In comparison, the true man of faith enjoys those things which give pleasure to the new man.

202
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:32,320
Ephesians 4, 23 and 24 tells us, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

203
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
What does the scripture tell us?

204
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:45,680
2 Corinthians 5, 17, Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation, and old things are passed away.

205
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,960
Behold, all things have become new.

206
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,560
I wonder, how is it with you today?

207
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,840
Have you put off the old man of the flesh with his deeds?

208
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,360
Have you by faith put on the new man of the Spirit?

209
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Have you sat down and reasoned with the Lord Jesus Christ receiving his joyous salvation and his pleasures forevermore?

210
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:20,000
Are you banking on the pleasures of sin that are but for a season and then comes eternal destruction?

211
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,680
Not simple destruction.

212
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Eternal destruction.

213
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,120
Forever.

214
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
Being destroyed.

215
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,840
But never being destroyed.

216
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:48,240
Finally, we would notice today that it is reasonable to trust in God because the present vision of faith is ample compensation for any temporal suffering and loss.

217
00:28:49,040 --> 00:29:04,080
Looking once again at our scripture in Hebrews 11 and verse 27 in the latter part of the verse, it says, he endured as seeing him who is invisible.

218
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,080
The Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

219
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:25,280
Moses believed God, and because he believed God, he had absolute confidence and the assurance of the precious hope which he could not see with the physical eyes.

220
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,360
He endured as seeing him who is invisible.

221
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,040
Faith is the evidence of things hoped for.

222
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,400
Or the substance of things hoped for.

223
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,920
The evidence of things not seen.

224
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
That's what faith is.

225
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,720
He looked beyond.

226
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,440
And he saw that which is eternal with eyes of faith, with eyes of the Spirit.

227
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:05,680
He saw beyond the things of the present, the pleasures of sin, and the enjoyments of the flesh that are but for a season.

228
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,320
He saw beyond the temporal sufferings and the loss he must experience.

229
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:23,840
He endured all these things, and with eyes of faith, he saw the future compensation in him who is invisible.

230
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,600
Oh, the man of faith is equipped with a kind of spiritual radar.

231
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:38,240
A spiritual radar that goes beyond and discerns those things the natural mind cannot see.

232
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:53,040
The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 2, 14, but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.

233
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,600
The unseen things of God.

234
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:06,880
The joys, the blessings, the everlasting assurance and satisfaction he gives are undiscoverable by the natural man.

235
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:22,560
That's why people continue in their old way because they can't see until God, by his marvelous grace, reaches down and opens the eyes.

236
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,200
You see, salvation is all of the grace of God.

237
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
It is nothing of man.

238
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,880
And my friend, you can't do anything about it.

239
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,120
If you're lost today, you're going to continue to be lost if you continue in your old way.

240
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080
So I'm going to do this.

241
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:52,000
But by God's grace, by his love and mercy, reaching down, and he opens your eyes, you can receive by faith.

242
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,920
And any person who seeks, any person who desires, any person who wants to know Christ, let me tell you, you can know it.

243
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Because Jesus said, Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.

244
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,840
He'll open the eyes of the blind.

245
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,560
And people who are lost in sin are blind.

246
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,320
God wants to save the lost soul.

247
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:30,480
In 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 9 it says, But as it is written, I hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

248
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:38,000
The precious things of God are revealed only to those who are prepared by faith and trust in him.

249
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,720
Verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 2 tells us, But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.

250
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,080
For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

251
00:32:50,720 --> 00:33:00,640
The worldly man, who does not believe and who has no faith, can see nothing ahead but clouds and fog.

252
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:16,480
And visibility is indeed bad, but how glorious and how comprehensive is faith's present vision, for by faith we can see through the clouds.

253
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,480
We can see through the fog to the throne of God.

254
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Oh, dear friends, is it not reasonable to trust in God?

255
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:42,720
Is it not a logical thing to put our faith in Him and suffer temporal afflictions and experience temporal loss when the glorious future compensations are so great?

256
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,000
My, what we have to look forward to.

257
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,440
What a joy that is ours if you're a child of God.

258
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:04,160
But if you're lost, you have nothing but an eternity of misery and pain and aches and sorrows.

259
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,680
But if you're a child of God, in the midst of our sorrows, in the midst of our pain, there is joy unspeakable.

260
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,840
There is victory.

261
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,240
There is hope.

262
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:27,520
If you're here today and you've never come to Christ to receive him into your heart and life by faith, I ask you to come and to trust him.

263
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,360
I ask you to just step out today at our invitation and cast away all your fears.

264
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Cast away all your earthly rules and powers and all those things that would be in the way.

265
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,360
Cast aside all the ties and the enticements that surround you.

266
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:54,640
Cast out the pleasures of sin for a season that bind you and trust Christ to save you.

267
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,360
The Word of God says this.

268
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,680
Come now.

269
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,480
Let us reason together, saith the Lord.

270
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,640
Though your sins be as clever, they shall be as white as you.

271
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,640
Though they be red like crimson, they shall be red like you.

272
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,480
Only God can be killed.

273
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,000
Only God can be king.

274
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,720
Only God can be a good thing.

275
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,240
Our hymn of invitation is number 198.

276
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.

277
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,360
Shall we stand together, please?

278
00:37:05,920 --> 00:39:29,760
Oh, so are you weary and dry the light in the darkness you see there's light forgetful and free Jesus and the things of earth will drop strangely in the light of his glory and grace haven't come up with yet I'll sing that third verse, shall we?

279
00:39:30,960 --> 00:40:33,920
His work shall not fail you, he promised Believe Him and all will be well strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.

280
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:09,840
When you listen to the service and started a certain course in school, many people can look back on a decision that has changed their lives more than any of these other decisions ever could.

281
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,840
That was the decision to surrender their hearts and lives to Jesus Christ.
